But what do these subjects have in common? It&rsquo;s clearly not their subject matter; astronomers study celestial bodies, biologists study living organisms, and chemists study matter and its properties. They also use different equipment and techniques; biologists aren&rsquo;t handy with radio telescopes, and chemists aren&rsquo;t trained to track a moose population in the wild. Despite these surface differences, the sciences share a common way of understanding the natural world, a systematic, rule-based approach to ask testable questions by collecting data.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.myr85ci2o7yw"><span class="c31 c41">1.1.1 Features of Science</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The general scientific approach has three fundamental features </span><span class="c4">(Stanovich, 2010)</span><span class="c4">. The first is </span><span class="c10 c4">systematic empiricism</span><span class="c4">, learning based on observation. Scientists learn about the natural world systematically, by carefully planning, recording, and analyzing observations. The second feature is that questions must be </span><span class="c10 c4">empirically testable</span><span class="c4">, in that they ask solvable problems. Here&rsquo;s an empirically testable question: Do people in comatose states show brain activity in response to commands? &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s not: If a machine replicates human brain activity, should it be given legal rights and protection? The first question can be asked by collecting evidence, the second one cannot </span><span class="c4">(DeepSeek, 2025)</span><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The third feature of science is that it </span><span class="c10 c4">creates public knowledge</span><span class="c0">. After making systematic observations and drawing their conclusions, scientists usually publish their work in a professional journal. Publication allows large-scale collaboration across time and space. Our current scientific knowledge is based on many studies conducted by different researchers who shared their work over the years. Publication allows others in the scientific community to scrutinize studies and detect errors, so over time, scientific knowledge increasingly reflects the way the world actually is.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.j0n30s4xtbjs"><span class="c31 c41">1.1.2 Science versus Pseudoscience</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Pseudoscience refers to activities and beliefs that are claimed to be scientific but aren&rsquo;t. It often starts with a valid observation, for instance, that soundwaves affect the physiology and behaviour of living things.

This idea was first proposed in the 1970&rsquo;s by Joseph Puleo, who derived these frequency values after analyzing numbers in the Bible </span><span class="c4">(RationalWiki, 2025)</span><span class="c4">. Later Leonard Horowitz promoted this concept in his book, </span><span class="c3">Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse</span><span class="c4">, where he describes the solfeggio frequencies as a rediscovered ancient method of healing </span><span class="c4">(Horowitz &amp; Puleo, 1999).</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This sounds far-fetched, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because these are testable questions. The problem is no one has found any scientific evidence to support these claims. Until this happens, the solfeggio frequencies fall under the realm of pseudoscience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c37 c10 c4">The solfeggio frequencies and their proposed effects (unsupported)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">396 Hz: Liberating guilt and fear</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">417 Hz: Facilitating change and undoing challenging situations</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">528 Hz: DNA repair and transformation</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">639 Hz: Connecting relationships and fostering harmony</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">741 Hz: Awakening intuition</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">852 Hz: Returning to spiritual order</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">A set of beliefs can be said to be pseudoscientific if 1) &nbsp;its adherents claim or imply that it is scientific but 2) it lacks basic features of science. It might lack systematic empiricism. Either there is no relevant scientific research or relevant scientific research but it is ignored. It might also lack public knowledge.

Learning about pseudoscience helps bring the fundamental features of science and their importance into sharper focus.

Research on the effects of cell phone use while driving were prompted by public safety concerns and we now have laws and hefty fines to limit this behaviour (Gaspar </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2014</span><span class="c0">). These distracted driving studies used the knowledge and techniques from basic research on the processes of perception, attention, and action, (Klein, 2000). &nbsp;Although the distinction between basic and applied research is convenient, it is not always clear-cut. </span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.z7sz2frmuvy3"><span class="c6">1.2 Bias in Research</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to Wikipedia, bias is &ldquo;&hellip;is disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;(Bias, 2024). There are many different ways that bias can creep into carefully designed scientific studies, but we&rsquo;ll focus on two categories: sampling bias, which occurs when the participant sample is not representative of the population, and cognitive biases, which are habitual thought processes that distort perceptions of data. Bias threatens the objectivity of scientific findings, so we&rsquo;ll explore strategies to minimize known biases. </span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.lzgf6nc0bwk2"><span>1.2.1 Sampling Bias</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">R</span><span class="c4">esearch on living beings involves sampling&mdash;selecting individuals to study from the population of interest. Sampling bias occurs when a sample is selected in such a way that it doesn&rsquo;t represent the entire population, yielding inaccurate results. </span><span class="c0">This was the reason for Literary Digest magazine&rsquo;s wildly inaccurate prediction of Alred Landon for the 1936 US &nbsp;presidential election. They contacted 10 million people and managed to get 2 million respondents, drawn from their own subscribers, telephone directories, and registered car owners. Although they had a huge sample size, it overrepresented wealthier people, who were more likely to own phones, cars, and magazines. They were also more likely to vote for Landon, who lost to Roosevelt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Sampling falls into two broad categories. </span><span class="c10 c4">Probability sampling</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;occurs when the researcher can specify the likelihood that a member of the population will be selected for the sample. </span><span class="c10 c4">Non-probability sampling</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;occurs when the researcher cannot specify likelihood. </span><span class="c10 c4">Convenience sampling</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c0">studying individuals who happen to be nearby and willing to participate, is a very common form of non-probability sampling used in psychological research.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There are a variety of different probability sampling methods. </span><span class="c10 c4">Simple random sampling</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is done in such a way that each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected. This could involve putting everyone&rsquo;s names into a hat, mixing them up, and then drawing out the number needed, which is done very easily with randomization software. Random-digit calls or texts are anoth</span><span class="c4">er </span><span class="c4">common approach, often used in market surveys and opinion polls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Sometimes simple random sampling leaves some members out. An alternative is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;stratified random sampling, where the population is divided into different subgroups or &ldquo;strata&rdquo; (usually based on demographics) and then a random sample is taken from each &ldquo;stratum.&rdquo; Stratified random sampling can be used to select a sample in which the proportion of respondents in each of the subgroups matches the population. This is a sensible strategy if you&rsquo;re interested in gender differences in pay in your company, especially if there&rsquo;s an established gender bias in the workforce. You could create strata based on self-reported gender and then randomly sample from these groups. This way you can ensure both representativeness </span><span class="c3">and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;random sampling </span><span class="c4">(Perplexity, 2025)</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">A</span><span class="c4">nother type of probability sampling is cluster sampling, where </span><span class="c4">the total population is divided into geographical groups, called clusters, and a random sample is selected from these. WIthin each selected cluster, researchers can include everyone, referred to as </span><span class="c10 c4">one-stage</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;sampling</span><span class="c4">, or they can choose another random subsample within the cluster, referred to as </span><span class="c10 c4">two-stage</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;sampling</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">(Cluster sampling, 2024). Cluster sampling is often used for survey research over large geographical distances, and is especially </span><span class="c4">useful for face-to-face interviewing because it minimizes travel for the interviewers. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There is one form of sampling bias that even careful random sampling can&rsquo;t solve. It&rsquo;s almost never the case that everyone selected actually responds. They may decline because they&rsquo;re too busy, aren&rsquo;t interested, or don&rsquo;t participate in research on principle. If these non-responders differ from responders in systematic ways, this can produce </span><span class="c10 c4">non-response bias</span><span class="c4">. In one survey study in the Netherlands, people were mailed a questionnaire on alcohol consumption and only about half responded after the initial contact and two follow-up reminders (</span><span class="c4">Lahaut, </span><span class="c3">et al</span><span class="c4">, 2002</span><span class="c0">). It&rsquo;s possible the half who responded differ in their patterns of alcohol consumption than the half who did not, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions. To address this, researchers later made unannounced visits to the homes of a subset of the non-responders, returning up to five times if they weren&rsquo;t home. They found that the original non-responders included a high proportion of nondrinkers, which meant that their estimates of alcohol consumption based only on the original responders were too high.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">T</span><span class="c4">he best approach to minimizing non-response bias is to minimize the number of non-responders, in other words, maximize the response rate. There is a large research literature on the factors that affect survey response rates (Groves et al., 2004). In general, in-person interviews have the highest response rates, followed by phone, mail, and online surveys. </span><span class="c0">The perceived length and complexity of the survey also makes a difference, which is why it is important to keep questionnaires as short and simple as possible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Lab-based experiments require more from participants, so these types of studies rarely use random sampling, and offer some sort of incentive. For community-based samples, participants are usually offered money to compensate for their time and travel to the facility, while university-based samples usually offer bonus grades to students. This is common practice in most psychology departments across the world, given the ease of recruiting cheap participants. This type of convenience sample is biased, yet the issue is rarely discussed in published research that relies on this type of sampling. If you randomly search research in psychology, you&rsquo;ll quickly find many examples of this.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.nvlfkhtlepx3"><span>1.2.2. </span><span class="c31 c41">Bias in Animal Research</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Sampling bias isn&rsquo;t restricted to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;human participants, it&rsquo;s common in animal research as well. For instance, most genetic manipulation studies in animal models of human diseases are done with mice. Their genes are easier to manipulate than other animals, and they&rsquo;re small so it&rsquo;s cheaper to breed them. However, the background mice strains used for genetic modification research differ dramatically. 129S1 mice show less overall activity than hyperactive C57BL/6 mice. Since most behavioural tests involve locomotion, differences in activity can distort interpretation of tests of memory, anxiety, and motivation </span><span class="c4">(O&rsquo;Leary </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2013).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There&rsquo;s a persistent sex bias in animal research; male animals have long been the default in models of human diseases, even for conditions more prevalent in women. In fact, many early studies in animals failed to report sex at all </span><span class="c10 c4">(Figure 1.1A</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Beery &amp; Zucker, 2011</span><span class="c4">). &nbsp;A 2010 review of science publications found a clear male bias in biological sciences, with neuroscience (5.5 males:1 female) and pharmacology (5 males:1 female) the worst offenders. &nbsp;Although sex bias has improved over time in human research (</span><span class="c10 c4">Figure 1.1B</span><span class="c4">), the proportion of studies using only male animals has remained steady </span><span class="c10 c4">(Figure 1.1A)</span><span class="c4">. Another review found an </span><span class="c3">increase</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in male-only research in neuroscience journals from 2010-2014 (31%-40%), whereas the proportion using females only remained stable and low (5%-6%) (</span><span class="c4">Will </span><span class="c3">et al</span><span class="c4">.; 2017)</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 378.79px; height: 500.76px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.png" style="width: 441.41px; height: 519.40px; margin-left: -27.28px; margin-top: -11.46px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Figure 1.1: Historical change in sex reporting and distribution in studies using animals (A) and humans (B).

(</span><span>Adapted from Beery &amp; </span><span>Zucker, 2010). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Why does this bias persist? Why is neuroscience so resistant to change? There&rsquo;s a strong misconception that the ovarian hormone cycle leads to unpredictable behaviour and physiology in females. Hormone effects can be determined by testing but many researchers accept that female hormones make data messy and exclude them (Will </span><span class="c3">et al</span><span class="c4">., </span><span class="c4">2017). Unlike humans, laboratory rats and mice aren&rsquo;t recruited, they&rsquo;re usually ordered from suppliers who will provide whatever age, sex, or strain required. This sampling bias in animal studies can be easily fixed.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/JvO8sWqhkQI?si%3DGwE5M0DyZLy4GBFB&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586573641&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xpmqBT0ZCdIdtGnTFqFAW">Sampling Bias video</a></span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.2o4i8xypndxg"><span class="c42">1.2.3 </span><span class="c19">Cognitive Bias</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Humans use mental shortcuts, called heuristics, to overcome our brain&rsquo;s limited processing power and solve problems efficiently. These heuristics are useful. but they sometimes lead to mistakes and when this happens, we call them biases. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cognitive biases are thought processes that skew judgements and perceptions. They&rsquo;re easy to ignore, so difficult to control. Let&rsquo;s consider an example. In English, is R more likely to appear in: the first position OR the third position? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Take a minute to think about it and write down your answer. This question was given to 152 participants in a classic series of studies in the 70s by Tversky and Kahneman, who later won the Nobel Prize for this work. What&rsquo;s the answer? Is that what you chose? Probably not. Most people, including 69% of these participants, incorrectly guessed 1</span><span class="c39 c4">st</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;position. They also guessed wrong for K, L, N, and, V, which are more frequently found in the 3</span><span class="c39">rd</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;position as well. (Kahneman, 2011)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why do people make this error? Well, it&#39;s way easier to think of words that begin with a letter compared to other positions in a word. Focusing on how words sound at the beginning is how we learn to speak and read. Rake, robbery, rabbit, and retriever, come more quickly to mind than marriage, darkness, carbon, and purity. This tendency to solve problems based upon how easily we can pull information into our awareness is called the availability heuristic. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another type of cognitive bias is what I call the hockey fan effect. Let&rsquo;s say you and a friend are watching a riveting hockey game. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re both huge fans of opposing teams, it&rsquo;s the final, the game is tied, AND you both bet money that your team will win. With 3 minutes to go, the ref makes a call on the star player of the black team, sending them to the penalty box, giving the white team, YOUR team, an advantage. Even though you and your friend both received almost identical information from your visual and auditory systems, you&#39;re delighted and your friend is upset. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is likely due to the confirmation bias, when people only look for evidence to support their beliefs and don&rsquo;t try and disprove them. Even though you saw the same thing as your friend, you looked for different evidence in making a judgement about the fairness of the ref&#39;s call. The hockey fan effect can be predicted by team loyalties, but careful scientists are humans, just like hockey fans, so sometimes these cognitive biases creep into research. Let&rsquo;s consider one famous example.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In an unusual field study, David Rosenhan (1973) had eight sane &ldquo;pseudopatients&rdquo;, 3 women and 5 men go to admissions at 12 different hospitals across the US. They claimed to hear a voice of the same gender saying the words &rdquo;empty&rdquo; &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; and &ldquo;thud&rdquo;. Other than this lie and using false names to conceal their identities, the pseudopatients behaved normally. ALL eight were misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted. The length of stay was on average 19 days, but ranged from 7-52. &nbsp;Rosenhan instructed his brave volunteers to document their experiences, which initially they kept hidden, but soon learned that no one really paid attention so they were able to take notes out in the open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This wasn&rsquo;t a well-controlled study, Rosenhan used a very small number of participants and the measures they took were not clearly defined, so this study&rsquo;s methods and ethics have been the target of criticism. However, the very fact that 8 psychologically healthy individuals tricked their way into psychiatric institutions by telling a few lies is proof in principle that diagnosis can be biased.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/bSey8btbG1o&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586579235&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rfB6yVUD_SVdDtorncWP3">Cognitive Bias video</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So how can we avoid cognitive biases? This is challenging, since it means examining our own thought processes and prejudices. It&rsquo;s almost as impossible as smelling your own smell, you&rsquo;re always with you so you become accustomed to it and can&rsquo;t detect it. However, by learning about common cognitive biases, and trying to think outside the box, it&rsquo;s possible to minimize the impact of this type of bias.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.50b3gt5yrpfn"><span class="c19">&nbsp;Key Takeaways</span></h3><ul class="c8 lst-kix_bnzinbj93uxv-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Science is a general way of understanding the natural world.

Fentanyl was created by scientists seeking better drugs to treat pain and met rigorous standards for human and animal testing in multiple countries (Stanley, 2014). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Ethics is a branch of philosophy that studies morality, which asks the question &ldquo;What should one do?&rdquo; (Meynell &amp; Paron, 2023).</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Research</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;ethics applies this framework to questions about scientific integrity, research misconduct, and treatment of research participants.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Every scholarly discipline has to deal with cases of data fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism, there are bad actors everywhere. </span><span class="c4">We expect scientists to be transparent about their data, which is why scandals involving falsifying results are so newsworthy, like Brian Wansink&rsquo;s &nbsp;&ldquo;pizza papers&rdquo; on eating habits in an all-you-can-eat buffet. Careful scrutiny of his published results revealed many statistical inconsistencies and mathematical impossibilities, which forced retractions from their respective publications (van der Zee </span><span class="c3">et al,</span><span class="c4">, 2017</span><span class="c4">).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">For researchers in the life sciences who work on living participants, there are extra considerations. We expect scientists to be honest to research subjects about the procedures they use and any possible harm. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why there are detailed ethics codes that provide guidance on important issues that commonly arise. In this section, we begin with a brief historical overview of such ethics codes and then look closely at the one that&rsquo;s most relevant to psychology and neuroscience research with human and non-humans in Canada. </span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.n7l1wk6k4ohq"><span>2.1 </span><span class="c6">Ethics Codes</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There are lots of ethics codes: the Bible&rsquo;s ten commandments, the Hippocratic oath for doctors, and the Golden Rule. Modern research ethics codes in Europe and North America arose from the Nuremberg Code, an outcome of the trials of Nazi doctors for the atrocities committed during World War II. From this, other ethical codes for using humans in research were developed. The Declaration of Helsinki was created</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;by the World Medical Association in 1964 to provide international standards for working with human participants (Carlson </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2004). The Belmont Report in 1978 was prompted by the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted by the US Public Health Service from 1932 to 1972. &nbsp;The participants were poor African-American men from Tuskegee, Alabama, who were told that they were being treated for &ldquo;bad blood.&rdquo; Instead, the researchers identified those who tested positive for syphilis and observed their disease progression, without telling them of their diagnosis or giving them access to effective treatments (Reverby, 2009). The study was eventually discontinued only after details were made public by journalists and activists. It&rsquo;s a harsh reminder that researchers need to consider issues of justice and fairness at the societal level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In North America, the APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (also known as the APA Ethics Code) was first published in 1953 and has been revised several times since then, most recently in 2002. It includes about 150 specific ethical standards that psychologists and their students are expected to follow. The Canadian Psychological Association officially adopted the APA code in 1977 before developing their own code in 1986 (Canadian Psychological Association, n.d.).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because ethical codes of conduct are created or revised in response to new injustices, they have specific differences, but their foundation is based upon a similar set of principles. We&rsquo;ll consider some of the most important aspects in detail: informed consent, deception, debriefing, as well as specific issues that arise when using humans and nonhuman animal participants.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.7ww0khhhbd0a"><span>2.1.1 </span><span class="c31 c41">Informed Consent</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I</span><span class="c0">nformed consent means obtaining and documenting people&rsquo;s agreement to participate in a study, having informed them of everything that might reasonably be expected to affect their decision. This includes details of the procedure, the risks and benefits of the research, the fact that they have the right to decline to participate or to withdraw from the study, the consequences of doing so. Consider the participants in the Tuskegee study. Although they agreed to participate in the study, they were not told that they had syphilis but would be denied treatment for it. Had they been told this basic fact about the study, it seems likely that they would not have agreed to participate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although the process of obtaining informed consent often involves having participants read and sign a consent form, it&rsquo;s more than that. Although having participants read and sign a consent form might be enough when they are competent adults with the necessary ability and motivation, many participants do not actually read consent forms or read them but do not understand them. We&rsquo;ve all signed user agreements for various online platforms to access their services, have you read the terms and conditions you&rsquo;ve accepted? (Figure 2)</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 222.50px; height: 278.38px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 222.50px; height: 278.38px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 377.62px; height: 275.46px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.png" style="width: 377.62px; height: 275.46px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Figure 2: </span><span class="c28">I Agree</span><span>&nbsp;is an art installation created by Dima Yarovinsky and highlights how users often consent to lengthy and complex terms of service agreements without reading them </span><span class="c5">(thishowthingswork, 2025).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Some participants consider consent forms as legal documents and mistakenly believe that by signing them they give up their right to sue the researcher (Mann, 1994). Even with adults it&rsquo;s good practice to tell participants about the risks and benefits, demonstrate the procedure, ask them if they have questions, and remind them of their right to withdraw at any time, </span><span class="c3">in addition</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to having them read and sign a consent form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are situations in which informed consent isn&rsquo;t necessary. &nbsp;If a study takes place in a public setting where privacy can&rsquo;t be reasonably expected, like a busy city street, shopping mall, or sports arena, harm and the procedure is straightforward or the study is conducted in the informed consent is not required. Say you&rsquo;re interested in real life helping behaviour, you could outside a public building and observe whether people hold the door open for people behind them. &nbsp;In this situation, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to obtain their informed consent. </span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.g7tkx4ddm0oh"><span>2.1.2 </span><span class="c31 c41">Deception</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Because both humans and non-human animals behave differently while being watched, this can alter natural behaviour so psychologists sometimes use deception to conceal the true intent of the research. </span><span class="c0">Deception in research can take a variety of forms: misinforming participants about the purpose of a study, providing participants with false feedback, and using confederates or phony equipment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Probably the best known example of deception in psychological research is Stanley Milgram&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3">Behavioral Study of Obedience</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1963)</span><span class="c0">. To study obedience in a realistic situation, Milgram lied to participants as soon as they arrived at the lab, giving them a cover story that they were looking at the effect of punishment on learning. &nbsp;There was one actual participant and another person, a confederate, acting as a participant but was employed by the researcher to behave in certain ways. The study was rigged so that the confederate was assigned the role of &ldquo;learner&rdquo; while the actual research participant took on the role of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo;. The teacher read words over a speaker to the learner in another room and punished mistakes with fake electric shocks, using an impressive looking (but fake) shock generator. &nbsp;With each incorrect response, the shock became stronger, eventually causing the learner to protest, complain about his heart, scream in pain, and finally fall silent and stop responding. Milgram wanted to see how far the teacher would continue before giving up and refusing to go on with the experiment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Using deception in this study makes sense. If you asked people on a survey if they would deliver electric shocks to an innocent victim who made some errors on a word recall test, most respondents would say no. In fact, Milgram found that 29 of the 40 original participants continued all the way to the end of the fake shock generator, despite being extremely distressed carrying out these orders. This shocking finding changed what we know about the power of obedience, and likely couldn&rsquo;t have happened without deception. However, Milgram&rsquo;s extreme methods led many to question whether the resulting scientific knowledge was worth the harm caused to the research participants (Baumrind, 1964). This research sparked a lot of discussion about obedience and debate about ethical behaviour of researchers, Milgram subjected his participants to extremely distressing conditions, and continued even when it became apparent the effect the procedure was having. However, this study is also strong evidence for the power of a research setting on volunteer behaviour.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Some researchers have argued that deception of research participants is rarely if ever ethically justified. Among their arguments are that it prevents participants from giving truly informed consent, fails to respect their dignity as human beings, has the potential to upset them, makes them distrustful and therefore less honest in their responding, and damages the reputation of researchers in the field (Baumrind, 1985).</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The CPA ethics code, however,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;allows deception when: 1) alternatives to deception don&rsquo;t exist, 2) harms can be predicted and offset, the benefits of the study outweigh the risks, 3) it allows </span><span class="c3">adequately</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;informed consent, such as level of risk or discomfort, 4</span><span class="c0">) only necessary deception is used, and 5) participants are informed about the deception as soon as possible (Canadian Psychological Association, 2017, p. 28).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This approach acknowledges that not all forms of deception are equally bad. How would you feel if you signed up for a memory experiment testing your recall of words but the researchers trick you and show you pictures instead? Technically, that&rsquo;s deception but it doesn&rsquo;t cause lasting harm. Although Milgram&rsquo;s deception was necessary to ask his research question, his methods resulted in unnecessary mental stress. How could he have done it differently?</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.61pvuy3sb7te"><span>2.1.3. </span><span class="c31 c41">Debriefing</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">This is the process of informing research participants as soon as possible of the purpose of the study, revealing any deception, and correcting any other misconceptions they might have as a result of participating. Debriefing also involves minimizing harm that might have occurred. For example, an experiment on the effects of being in a sad mood on memory might involve inducing a sad mood in participants by having them think sad thoughts, watch a sad video, or listen to sad music. Debriefing would be the time to return participants&rsquo; moods to normal by having them think happy thoughts, watch a happy video, or listen to happy music. To Milgram&rsquo;s credit, he went to great lengths to debrief his participants and he followed up with them for years afterward </span><span class="c4">(Milgram, 1964)</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;The majority thought the research was valuable and were glad to have participated. Still, this research is considered unethical by today&rsquo;s standards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Scientific research in psychology can be ethical only if its risks are outweighed by its benefits, which is tricky because they might not be may not be directly comparable. For example, risks of a study are usually carried by its research participants while the benefits are experienced more broadly by society. Stanley Milgram&rsquo;s original study on obedience to authority (1963) is an excellent example of this and the debate about the cost-benefit ratio still continues.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/P5maG7tibDw&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586606947&amp;usg=AOvVaw28ANEGB0ccur1W-nHghGeT">Research Ethics video</a></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.i2wuaedsd0af"><span>2.1.4 </span><span>Research with Humans</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the conveniences in using human participants in research is, simply, that you can ask them. The way people are recruited matters since there are costs in research participation, even very low-risk studies require people to volunteer their time. There are several approaches to recruiting participants; most university psychology departments maintain a subject pool consisting of students enrolled in psychology courses, where researchers post descriptions of their studies and students sign up to participate. &nbsp;Sometimes participation is required or students are offered small bonus grades. &nbsp;Participants outside of subject pools, such as non-students, can also be recruited by posting advertisements to groups that represent the population of interest. However, they aren&rsquo;t interested in bonus points so other incentives are offered, such as entry into a raffle or a small amount of money to compensate for time. Regardless of their reasons for participation, volunteers&rsquo; behaviour might not be representative of the general public out in the real world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People who volunteer to participate in research have been shown to differ in predictable ways from those who don&rsquo;t volunteer. Compared to non-volunteers, research volunteers are, on average, more interested in the topic being studied, more educated, have a greater need for approval, and are in a higher socioeconomic group (Rosenthal Rosnow, 1976). There&rsquo;s a danger of an unrepresentative sample if participants with these characteristics behave differently than the general population. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">In field research, the task is not recruiting participants but selecting them. For example, researchers Nicolas Gu&eacute;guen and Marie-Agn&egrave;s de Gail conducted a field experiment on the effect of being smiled at on helping on shoppers at a supermarket. A confederate walking down a stairway gazed directly at a shopper walking up the stairway and either smiled or did not smile. Shortly afterward, the shopper encountered another confederate, who dropped some computer disks on the ground. The dependent variable was whether or not the shopper stopped to help pick them up (Gu&eacute;guen &amp; de Gail, 2003). Notice that these participants were not &ldquo;recruited,&rdquo; but the researchers still had to select them from among all the shoppers taking the stairs that day. It is extremely important that this kind of selection be done according to a well-defined set of rules established before the data collection begins. In this case, with each trip down the stairs, the confederate was instructed to gaze at the first person they encountered who appeared to be between the ages of 20 and 50. Only if the person gazed back did they become a participant in the study. The point of having a well-defined selection rule is to avoid bias in the selection of participants. For example, if the confederate was free to choose which shoppers they would gaze at, they might choose friendly-looking shoppers for the smiling condition and unfriendly-looking ones for the control. These biases can be entirely unintentional, so bias-reducing procedures are important.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/VTvsu1jmPg0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586611598&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oocrB2HPkubjh9gxsmwZi">Research with Humans video</a></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.jl81rumg3k8z"><span>2.1.5 </span><span class="c31 c41">Nonhuman Animal Subjects</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Animals and humans share many biological and psychological traits but research with animals is different in several ways. Research on animal behaviour usually falls into two broad categories: 1) the animal is the subject of interest like primatologist Jane Goodall&rsquo;s work on chimpanzees (Ross </span><span class="c3">et al,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;2011)</span><span class="c4">, or the animal serves as a model for humans like the work Jennifer Stamp (=me) did on stress and cocaine effects in rats (Stamp </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2008). </span><span class="c0">Goodall devoted her life to studying chimpanzees in the wild, focusing mainly on social behaviour. Her motivation for her work stems from an interest in chimpanzees themselves. Me, Jen Stamp, on the other hand studied rodents, mainly rats, in the laboratory, but my motivation came from my interest in human stress and addiction, not because I&rsquo;ve ever been specifically interested in rat cocaine use. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Field and laboratory research studies follow internationally recognized standards of regulatory bodies, in Canada this is the CCAC or Canadian Council on Animal Care. However, in general field research tends to be less invasive and harmful than laboratory research. Since the majority of laboratory research uses animals as models of human processes and disease, this type of research is very different from laboratory research in humans. Probably the most important issue in non-human animal research is the fact that they don&rsquo;t volunteer to participate, they&rsquo;re not able. It&rsquo;s probably safe to say that even if they </span><span class="c3">could</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;communicate with us, they&rsquo;d most certainly decline participation that causes harm. This is especially true since animal models are often justified for procedures deemed too harmful to use in human participants. Animal researchers and society at large have continued to grapple with this and rules regarding the treatment of animals in research have changed dramatically over time. Let&rsquo;s consider one simple example.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The ability to control the rats&rsquo; living conditions is great for research design, we can ensure that participants are treated the same, this is impossible with humans who go on to their own lives after they&rsquo;ve completed the research study. However rats are burrowing creatures and have very busy lives in the wild, constantly foraging for food, sometimes over large distances. A standard laboratory cage is not a happy place for them. How do we know this? One group of researchers showed that environmental enrichment, by providing things to chew on and hide in, reduces levels of stress hormones in lab rats (Belz </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;2003)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is supported by mountains of other research, which means that the standard rat housing conditions throughout most of the history of psychology and neuroscience research was a condition of stress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Like humans, animals can also be influenced by the experimenters carrying out the research. One interesting study looked at the effects of exposure of male and female rats to male and female humans (Sorge </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;2014), by measuring the same stress hormones in the environmental enrichment study (Belz </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2003). These r</span><span class="c4">esearchers found that rats exposed to a female experimenter showed hormone levels similar to controls, but exposure to even a t-shirt worn by a man caused elevated levels, suggesting this is probably a result of odors. Does this mean that biological males stress out rodents? Should female-only researchers be allowed to work with laboratory rodents? This isn&rsquo;t feasible since it clearly discriminates against male participation in some fields of research, but evidence suggests it could reduce stress in laboratory animals. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/ytZmq9JqsTg&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586617251&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rGoFiNyacUfgdfPJSxqG8">Research with Animals video</a></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.9qain8t007qs"><span class="c31 c41">Key Takeaways</span></h3><ul class="c8 lst-kix_mbhgm5tnobb7-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">There are several written ethics codes for research with human participants that provide specific guidance on the ethical issues that arise most frequently.

(2019) for the Canadian Science Policy Conferences, Ottawa, ON</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A recent survey paints a surprising picture of the state of science in Canada. While the vast majority of Canadians &mdash; 84 percent &mdash; believe science improves their quality of life, over half feel more should be done to make scientific information understandable to the public.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This responsibility increasingly falls on scientists, who are seen as some of the most trusted sources of scientific information. Yet few receive formal training in how to share their work beyond the academic sphere, and many struggle to communicate their ideas effectively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why we chose to focus our CSPC panel on communicating science to nonacademic audiences. Turning to four science topics Canadians identify as concerning &mdash; vaccinations, climate change, artificial intelligence, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs, Fig 3.1) &mdash; we developed a hands-on workshop aimed at mobilizing knowledge and dispelling misperceptions about these controversial issues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this editorial, we share the challenges we faced in finding (and accessing) high quality research about the four topics without privileged access to academic databases, and reflect on the implications for public understanding of science.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 594.50px; height: 331.59px;"><img alt="" src="images/image13.png" style="width: 594.50px; height: 331.59px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Figure 3.1 Key science topics like vaccination, genetically modified organisms, climate change, and artificial intelligence remain controversial among Canadians.

Adapted from John Sopinski (Globe and Mail) with data from Leger / Ontario Science Centre.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How do publics learn about science?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Given that our goal was to communicate science beyond the academic sphere, we decided to seek out research about vaccines, climate change, artificial intelligence, and GMOs as if we were interested members of the public, rather than scientists and science communicators.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We know from recent studies that publics are increasingly learning about science online, often through &ldquo;layman&rsquo;s&rdquo; sources like news stories, science blogs, and social media posts. Although scholarly literature is not typically seen as a top source of public science information, research suggests that people unaffiliated with universities do rely on it&mdash;if they have access, that is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With this in mind, we set aside our institutional logins, scouring the web for open access research through library repositories, preprint servers, and more. To do so, we relied on freely available search tools, like Google Scholar and PubMed, rather than paid services like Web of Science.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What did we find? Not only was conducting research this way far more challenging than using academic search tools, it also led to many dead ends. Despite the continued growth of Open Access publishing, we came up against paywalls again and again. So much of the research we found was locked away beyond our reach.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 531.50px; height: 237.64px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 531.50px; height: 237.64px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Figure 3.2 Scientists tend to have greater access to science than most members of the public. Image created by Julia Krolik (Pixels and Plans).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What does &ldquo;quality&rdquo; mean, anyway?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our selection of articles was further limited by considerations of scientific rigour. Many of the articles we found relied heavily on discipline-specific jargon and insider knowledge. Without extensive training in the topic at hand, identifying how to separate the scholarly wheat from the chaff was no simple feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What counts as &lsquo;high quality&rsquo; or &lsquo;reliable&rsquo; research?,&rdquo; we wondered. &ldquo;Which articles can be trusted and which should be read more critically?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While journal- and article- metrics are often seen as markers for research quality, their use in research evaluation has been widely critiqued. Citation counts, for example, vary dramatically from discipline to discipline, and show almost no relation to the appropriateness of an article&rsquo;s statistical analysis or the quality of its reporting. The journal impact factor has similarly been deemed inappropriate for making article-level assessments of quality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead, we evaluated research articles using qualitative factors:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Participants: Was the research conducted on humans or animals? How large and representative was the sample?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Study design: Was the study a single experiment or case study, or a randomized-controlled trial, meta-analysis, or review?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Conflicts of interest: Who funded the research and what stake did they have in the outcomes?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Relevance: Are the findings directly applicable to Canadians&rsquo; lives?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finding research that matched these criteria was far more challenging &mdash; not to mention time-consuming &mdash; than simply choosing the top-cited articles for each of our four topics. But we hoped they would offer audiences a more nuanced take on the issues at hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Making science &ldquo;public&rdquo; is no easy task</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What did this exercise teach us? Even though everyone on our team has research experience, we all struggled to find high quality scientific articles about our chosen topics that were publicly available. Academic papers, we discovered, are inaccessible to the public in two ways: most are paywalled, but the greater issue is the scientific jargon that makes it challenging to assess the quality of the experiments and their results.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, if we truly care about making our science &ldquo;public,&rdquo; we need to start thinking like the publics we are trying to reach. Where do they look for answers to scientific questions? What kind of language do they use? In which formats do they prefer to receive information?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Answering these questions means exploring alternative forms of science communication that truly engage publics, such as the visual techniques we will cover in our CSPC panel Creating SciComm. By communicating our research in more accessible, understandable ways, we can build a new relationship between science and society &mdash; one that we hope will ultimately lead to a better understanding of, and ultimately trust in, science.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/0a10DomfmGc&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586635600&amp;usg=AOvVaw3wc-FU5OkTXbeybsafBNmb">Science Communication video</a></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.15k1pf4sr03r"><span>3.2 Science on Repeat</span></h2><p class="c22"><span class="c4">Adapted from Frank </span><span class="c3">et al., </span><span class="c4">(</span><span class="c4">2025). </span><span class="c3">Experimentology: An Open Science Approach to Experimental Psychology Methods.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Stanford University</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">In recent years there&rsquo;s an increasing recognition that our idealized view of science might not be a good description of what we actually see in the literature. Psychology and medicine in particular have been scrutinized since many classic findings may be wrong, or at least overstated. How do we know about this? Metascience, sometimes called </span><span class="c3">science of science</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c3">research on research</span><span class="c0">, is a field of study that focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of scientific research (Metascience, 2025). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">A red flag that a study might be of &nbsp;low quality is if other scientists can&rsquo;t repeat it. &nbsp;There are a few ways to redo a study (Figure 3.1). For a particular finding in a paper, if we take the same data, do the same analysis, and get the same result, we call that finding </span><span class="c10 c4">reproducible</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(sometimes, analytically or computationally reproducible). If we collect </span><span class="c3">new</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;data using the same methods, do the same analysis, and get the same result, we call that a</span><span class="c10 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">replication</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and say that the finding is </span><span class="c10 c4">replicable</span><span class="c4">.

The last quadrant empty because there&rsquo;s no specific term for it, the closest is probably</span><span class="c10 c4">&nbsp;generalizable</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;conclusions from a large body of results, but this means more than just having a finding that is reproducible and replicable.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15 c67" id="h.bjk3nlknuejr"><span class="c31 c41"></span></h3><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 528.50px; height: 297.45px;"><img alt="A table with cols dataset (same/different), rows analysis (same/different). 1st row reproducible, replicable; 2nd row robust." src="images/image4.png" style="width: 528.50px; height: 297.45px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Figure 3.1: A framework for understanding different terms related to the repeatability of scientific findings (based on Whitaker 2017).</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.cbpxvt65hqj9"><span>3.2.1 </span><span class="c31 c41">Reproducibility</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Scientific papers are full of numbers: sample sizes, measurements, statistical results, and graphs. For those numbers to have meaning, and for other scientists to verify them, we need to know where they came from, called their provenance. The chain of actions that scientists perform on the raw data, all the way through to reporting numbers in their papers, is sometimes called the </span><span class="c10 c4">analysis pipeline</span><span class="c0">. For much of history, scientific papers have only provided a verbal description of the analysis pipeline, usually with little detail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Sharing key research objects from this pipeline, like the raw data and analysis scripts, isn&rsquo;t standard practice (</span><span class="c4">Hardwicke et al. 2021)</span><span class="c0">. Without the data and code, the numbers reported in scientific papers are often NOT reproducible, an independent scientist can&rsquo;t repeat all of the steps in the analysis pipeline and get the same results as the original scientists.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reproducibility is desirable for a number of reasons. Without it, errors in calculation or reporting could lead to disparities between the reported result and the actual result. Vague verbal descriptions of analytic computations aren&rsquo;t helpful since they prevent readers from understanding the statistics that were actually performed and &nbsp;robustness to alternative analyses can&rsquo;t be checked. Synthesizing evidence across studies, a key part of building a cumulative body of scientific knowledge, is much more difficult without re-analyzing published data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">From this list, error detection and correction are probably the most pressing issues. But are errors common? There are plenty of individual instances of errors that are corrected in the published literature (e.g., some of us found an error in </span><span class="c4">Cesana-Arlotti et al. 2018)</span><span class="c4">, and we ourselves have made significant analytic errors (</span><span class="c4">Frank et al. 2013</span><span class="c0">). But these kinds of experiences don&rsquo;t tell us about the frequency of errors more generally or the consequences of error for the conclusions that researchers draw.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Estimating the frequency of errors is a metascientific issue that researchers have attempted to answer over the years. If errors are frequent, that would suggest a need for changes in our policies and practices to reduce their frequency! Unfortunately, the lack of data availability creates a problem: it&rsquo;s hard to figure out if calculations are wrong if you can&rsquo;t check them in the first place. Here&rsquo;s one clever approach to this issue. In standard American Psychological Association (APA) reporting format, inferential statistics must be reported with three pieces of information: the test statistic, the degrees of freedom for the test, and the p-value (e.g. t(18)=-0.74, p=0.47). Yet, these pieces of information are redundant with one another. Reported statistics can be checked for consistency simply by evaluating whether they line up with one another&mdash;that is, whether the p-value recomputed from the and t degrees of freedom matches the reported value.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Bakker and Wicherts (2011)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;performed this kind of statistical consistency analysis on a sample of 281 papers, and found that around 18% of statistical results were incorrectly reported. Even more worrisome, around 15% of articles contained at least one decision error, meaning it changed the direction of the inference that was made (e.g., from significant to insignificant). </span><span class="c4">Nuijten et al. (2016)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;used an automated method called &ldquo;statcheck&rdquo; to confirm and extend this analysis. They checked p-values for more than 250,000 psychology papers in the period 1985&ndash;2013 and found that around half of all papers contained at least one incorrect p-value!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In sum: transparency is a critical imperative for decreasing the frequency of errors in the published literature. Reporting and computation errors are frequent in the published literature, and the identification of these errors depends on the findings being reproducible. If data are not open and available, then errors usually cannot be found. However, research that uses human participants is bound by ethical obligations of privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent, so full access to open data isn&rsquo;t usually possible (or desirable). Anonymization can solve the privacy issue, but informed consent is trickier with data sharing since the participant is being asked to consent for future studies with unknown researchers.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.tsg8wuig7yxc"><span>3.2.2 </span><span class="c31 c41">Replication</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beyond verifying a paper&rsquo;s original analysis pipeline, we are often interested in understanding whether the study can be replicated&mdash;if we repeat the study methods and obtain new data, do we get similar results? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Replications can be conducted for many reasons </span><span class="c4">(Schmidt 2009</span><span class="c4">). One goal can be to verify that the results of an existing study can be obtained again if the study is conducted again in exactly the same way, to the best of our abilities. A second goal can be to expand the results by conducting a larger replication study, or combining the results of a replication study with the existing study. A third goal can be to investigate whether an effect will persist when, for example, the experimental manipulation is done in a different, but still theory-consistent, manner. Alternatively, we might want to investigate whether the effect persists in a different population. Such replications are often efforts to </span><span class="c3">replicate and extend</span><span class="c4">, and are common both when the same research team wants to conduct a sequence of experiments that each build on one another or when a new team wants to build on a result from a paper they have read (</span><span class="c4">Rosenthal 1990</span><span class="c0">).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A lot is at stake in this discussion. If Dr. Frog publishes a finding with Australian undergraduates and Dr. Toad then &ldquo;replicates&rdquo; the procedure in Germany, should we be concerned if the effect is different in size or absent? Meta-researchers have made a number of statistical techniques and quantify the degree of methodological consistency between two experiments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Some make a distinction between </span><span class="c10 c4">direct replications</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c10 c4">conceptual replications</span><span class="c4">. Direct replications are those that attempt to reproduce all of the salient features of the prior study as precisely as possible, for instance using the same gender for the experimenter. In contrast, conceptual replications attempt to test the same hypothesis through different operationalizations of the manipulation or measure. Labeling this second type of experiment as a replication is a bit misleading (</span><span class="c4">Zwaan et al., 2018)</span><span class="c0">. Conceptual replications are actually different tests of the theory and can be extremely valuable, but they serve a different goal than replication</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.tgd32333prxm"><span>3.2.3 </span><span class="c31 c41">Open Science Collaboration</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Around 2011, we were teaching our Experimental Methods course for graduate students in Psychology at Stanford University for the first time. We used an innovative course model in collaboration with Rebecca Saxe (</span><span class="c4">Frank and Saxe 2012</span><span class="c0">) to introduce students to the nuts and bolts of research by having them run replications. A researcher named Brian Nosek was on sabbatical nearby, and over coffee we learned that he was starting up an ambitious project to replicate a large sample of studies published in top psychology journals in 2008.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the course that year we chose replication projects from the sample that Nosek had told us about. Four of these projects were executed very well and were nominated by the course TAs for inclusion in the broader project. A few years later, when the final group of 100 replication studies was completed, we got a look at the results (figure 3.2).</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 539.50px; height: 407.30px;"><img alt="A scatterplot with red (significant) and blue (not significant) points; blue points tend to be lower than red points." src="images/image14.png" style="width: 539.50px; height: 407.30px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Figure 3.2: Results from the Open Science Collaboration (2015).

Dot size represents estimated statistical power. The grey line represents a perfect replication.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The resulting metascience paper, which we and others refer to as the Replication Project in Psychology (RPP), made a massive impression on psychologists and the broader research community, defining both a field of psychology metascience studies and providing a template for many-author collaborative projects (</span><span class="c4">Open Science Collaboration 2015</span><span class="c4">). But the most striking thing was the result: disappointingly, </span><span class="c10 c4">only around a third of the replications had similar findings to the original studies</span><span class="c0">. The others yielded smaller effects that were not statistically significant in the replication sample (almost all of the original studies were significant). The RPP provided the first large-scale evidence that there were systematic issues with replicability in the psychology literature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The RPP&rsquo;s results and their interpretation were controversial, however, and much ink was spilled on what these data showed. Critics pointed to different degrees of fidelity between the original studies and the replications, insufficient levels of statistical power and low evidential value in the replications, non-representative sampling of the literature; and difficulties identifying specific statistical outcomes for replication success (</span><span class="c4">Gilbert et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2016; Etz and Vandekerckhove 2016</span><span class="c0">). In our view, many of these critiques have merit, and you can&rsquo;t simply interpret the results of RPP as an unbiased estimate of the replicability of results in the literature, contra the title.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, RPP&rsquo;s results are still important and compelling, and they undeniably changed the direction of the field of psychology. Many good studies are like this&mdash;they have flaws but they inspire follow-up studies that can address those problems. For several of us personally, working on this project was also transformative in that it showed us the power of collaborative work. Together we could do a study that no one of us had any hope of completing on our own, and potentially make a difference in our field.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/wCEz1agkROM&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586653866&amp;usg=AOvVaw0swecMWVRf2F8zjbM0ZXTL">Replication video</a></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.i0hmw1d92r3"><span class="c19">Key Takeaways</span></h3><ul class="c8 lst-kix_961b277qsc17-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Barriers to science communication to the public include jargon, paywalls, lack of clarity in language, and more accessible non-academic alternatives</span></li><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Repeating science is important for consensus about results, and can be done by reproducing using the same data, replicating using new data, or a robustness check using new data and different analyses </span></li><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">The Open Science Collaboration is a metascience project that replicated only a third of the original research studies sampled from journals in psychology</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c32"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.u5a20nig4nes"><span class="c6">Research Reporting References</span></h2><p class="c1"><span>Anderson, Christopher J, Bahn&iacute;k &Scaron;t&#283;p&aacute;n, Barnett-Cowan Michael, Bosco Frank A, Chandler Jesse, Chartier Christopher R, Cheung Felix, et al.

Simply, a </span><span class="c10 c4">variable</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;something that varies across individuals or situations, like the height of students in a course. Height is a </span><span class="c3">quantitative (or numerical) </span><span class="c4">variable, which means it can be represented by a number and you can do math-y things like calculate averages. Other quantitative variables include the number of siblings someone has, their resting heart rate, and the firing rate of a neuron. </span><span class="c3">Continuous</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;quantitative</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;variables can take on any value within a range, like height, since people can be any height within the range observed for humans. </span><span class="c3">Discrete</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;quantitative variables can only assume a certain all-or-none value, like the number of siblings (since siblings only come in whole numbers). A </span><span class="c3">qualitative </span><span class="c4">variable is one that can&rsquo;t be measured by a number, like eye colour, gender, or nationality. Whereas quantitative variables represent an amount, </span><span class="c3">qualitative</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">variables represent a quality, and are indicated by labels rather than numbers. They&rsquo;re also called </span><span class="c3">categorical</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c3">discrete</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;variables and although they can be counted, you can&rsquo;t combine values into averages. For instance, you could determine the gender frequencies of people in your neighbourhood, but you can&rsquo;t calculate an average gender (Statistics Canada, nd).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There are many ways to measure variables, which yield different types of data. </span><span class="c10 c4">Self-report </span><span class="c4">measures are those in which participants report on their own thoughts, feelings, and actions, as with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. A </span><span class="c10 c4">report by other</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is collected from someone (also called an informant) who knows the individual of interest well, like a romantic partner, co-worker, or family member (Bages </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 1997).</span><span class="c10 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Teacher and Parent Rating Scale or SNAP-IV is an example of a commonly used report by other used to assess ADHD in young children </span><span class="c0">(&ldquo;SNAP-IV&rdquo;, 2024).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Behavioural measures</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;record participants&rsquo; behaviour according to pre-arranged criteria and can be done in both in highly structured laboratory tasks and natural settings. A good example of the former would be measuring working memory capacity using the backward digit span task. A good example of the latter is a famous operational definition of physical aggression from researcher Albert Bandura and colleagues (</span><span class="c4">Bandura, 1963</span><span class="c4">). They let each of several children play for 20 minutes in a room that contained a clown-shaped punching bag called a Bobo doll. They filmed each child and counted the number of acts of physical aggression they committed over a 20 min period. </span><span class="c10 c4">Physiological measures </span><span class="c4">are those that involve recording any of a wide variety of physiological processes, including heart rate and blood pressure, galvanic skin response, hormone levels, and electrical activity and blood flow in the brain. Finally,</span><span class="c10 c4">&nbsp;tests</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are a mix of self-report and behavioural approaches and usually involve performance tasks like a standard IQ test, or perceptual task, like the Ishihara colour blindness test.</span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/-fBoUM1rn7Y&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586666540&amp;usg=AOvVaw075vEpH5pzGo8wdYSOB96R">Types of Data video</a></span></p><h3 class="c52 c15" id="h.tmqk68w3o6k5"><span class="c31 c41">4.1.1 Defining Variables</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Psychologists, neuroscientists and others interested in thought, emotion, and behaviour study abstract concepts like memory, aggression, and stress. These terms are familiar to everyone but tricky to nail down because there are many ways of expressing them. Therefore the first step is defining a </span><span class="c10 c4">construct</span><span class="c4">, which is a clear definition of the concept being studied. Constructs allow people to create labels for ideas that can&rsquo;t be directly measured. This helps clear up potential confusion because the same word can mean different things to different people. Stress is a good example. In psychology, stress refers to an internal state of perceived threat that exceeds an individual&rsquo;s ability to cope (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 2025). In geology, that same term refers to the force per unit area on a rock or other material (MacBeth </span><span class="c3">et al.,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;2018</span><span class="c0">).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first step in research is defining a construct, which is a clear definition of a concept being studied. Constructs allow people to create labels for abstract ideas that can&rsquo;t be directly measured. This helps clear up potential confusion because words mean different things to different people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Let&rsquo;s look at a construct we&rsquo;re familiar with from everyday life, intelligence. You can&rsquo;t determine someone&rsquo;s intelligence just by looking at them, so what variables do you think constitute intelligence? How can this best be measured? In 1921 the leading scholars in intelligence research, including giants like Terman, Thurstone, and Thorndike were asked these same questions, and although there was overlap in their definitions, they couldn&rsquo;t come up with a consensus. Six decades later, after widespread use of standardized IQ tests, leading intelligence scholars tried again, with big names like Sternberg, Gardner, and Horn contributing to this discussion. Again, despite overlap in their definitions, there wasn&rsquo;t strong agreement on what variables contribute to intelligence (Intelligence Symposium, 1921). So where does that leave us? If scholars who study intelligence can&rsquo;t agree on a definition, is it even possible to study it scientifically? The answer is yes, as long as the construct is clearly defined and there&rsquo;s a feasible way to measure it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Turning a construct into a useful variable requires an </span><span class="c10 c4">operational definition</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c4">which is a precise description of how a construct will be measured. For any given variable or construct, there will be multiple operational definitions. Let&rsquo;s look at psychological </span><span class="c4">stress again. A rough conceptual definition is that stress is a state of perceived danger or threat that involves physiological, cognitive, affective, and behavioural components.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;But researchers operationally define it in several ways. The Social Readjustment Rating Scale is a self-report questionnaire on which people identify stressful events that they have experienced in the past year and assign points for each one depending on its severity (Wallace </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2023)</span><span class="c4">. For example, someone who has been divorced (73 points), changed jobs (36 points), and had a change in sleeping habits (16 points) in the past year would have a total score of 125. Researchers who study animal models of stress operationally define it in terms of physiological variables including blood pressure and levels of stress hormones. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/h1uEMdFn9VE&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586671811&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Ss8balwrvboMyOjexSmEL">Defining Variables video</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">When researchers</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;use multiple operational definitions of the same construct&mdash;either within a study or across studies&mdash;they&rsquo;re using converging operations. The idea is that the various operational definitions are &ldquo;converging&rdquo; on the same construct. When scores based on several different operational definitions are closely related and produce similar patterns of results, this is good evidence that the construct is being measured effectively and that it&rsquo;s useful. The various measures of stress, for example, are all correlated with each other and have all been shown to be correlated with other variables such as immune system functioning (also measured in a variety of ways) (</span><span class="c4">Segerstrom &amp; Miller, 2004</span><span class="c4">).</span></p><h2 class="c22 c15 c58" id="h.euv0c730ix0p"><span class="c0"></span></h2><h2 class="c22 c15" id="h.j6kgysyegtsg"><span>4.2 </span><span class="c6">Quality of Measures</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Measurement involves assigning scores to represent characteristics of the individuals being studied. But how do researchers know that the scores actually represent the characteristic, especially a construct like working memory capacity or self-esteem? Researchers don&rsquo;t simply assume that their measures work, they collect data to demonstrate it. In evaluating a measurement method, researchers must consider two general dimensions of quality: </span><span class="c10 c4">reliability </span><span class="c4">and </span><span class="c10 c4 c37">validity.</span></p><h3 class="c15 c63" id="h.9solvxj6naa5"><span>4.2.1 </span><span class="c31 c41">Reliability</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure. There are many different types of reliability but we&rsquo;ll focus on two: consistency over time, called </span><span class="c3">test-retest reliability</span><span class="c10 c4">,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and across different researchers, called </span><span class="c3">inter-rater reliability</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">If a measure has high test-retest reliability, it should produce similar scores every time it&rsquo;s taken. To assess this, researchers administer the measure twice with the same participants and calculate a test-retest correlation between the two sets of scores. In general, a test-retest correlation of +0.80 or greater is considered to indicate good reliability.</span><span class="c4 c27">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">For example, intelligence is thought to be consistent across the lifespan, so a good measure of intelligence should produce roughly the same scores for someone tested today and year from now. Standardized intelligence tests like the WAIS and WISC show very high test-retest reliability, with correlations between +0.80-0.90 &nbsp;(Schuerger &amp; Witt, 1989).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">While test-retest focuses on research participants, inter-rater reliability is concerned with experimenters; it&rsquo;s the extent to which different observers are consistent in their judgments. It&rsquo;s important for measures that involve a decision, like behavioural coding. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re interested in playground bullying and you have permission from the students, teachers, and parents at three local schools to access video from the school&rsquo;s security cameras during lunchtime for the whole year. This is an exciting amount of data, but you need to recruit help to code the thousands of hours of video. You decide to follow Wendy Craig and Debra Pepler&rsquo;s definition of bullying: intent to cause harm where the aggressor is more powerful than the victim (Craig &amp; Pepler, 2007). To ensure that operational definitions are being applied in the same way, it&rsquo;s common with this type of design to compare ratings of the same videos by different coders. Inter-rater reliability is often assessed using Cronbach&rsquo;s &alpha; (alpha) for quantitative data or a similar statistic called Cohen&rsquo;s &kappa; (kappa) for categorical data. In Craig &amp; Pepler&rsquo;s published work on playground bullying, their inter-rater reliability is around +0.80 (Hawkins </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2001).</span></p><h3 class="c52 c15" id="h.9xpllq5me96u"><span>4.2.2 </span><span class="c31 c41">Validity</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Validity is the extent to which the scores from a measure represent the variable they&rsquo;re intended to. </span><span class="c4">An</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;important challenge researchers face when designing a study is to find the right balance between ensuring </span><span class="c10 c4">internal validity</span><span class="c4">, or the degree to which a study allows unambiguous causal inferences, and </span><span class="c10 c4">external validity</span><span class="c4">, or the degree to which a study ensures that potential findings apply to settings and samples other than the ones being studied. Unfortunately, these two properties often clash. This is because creating a controlled setting often creates an environment that is quite different from what people naturally encounter. If an experiment is far-off from what someone might normally experience in everyday life, you might reasonably question how useful its findings are. </span><span class="c10 c4">Ecological validity</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a subtype of external validity and is whether an effect can be generalized to realistic life situations (Brewer, 2000). </span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.w4bi285d3q8p"><span class="c6">4.3 Time of Day Effects</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In most living creatures, cognitive abilities, physiological processes, and behaviours vary through the day and night, which introduces a potential time of day bias to data collection. Most lab-based research participation usually happens during regular working hours, from 9 to 5ish, while online, survey-based research is more flexible and can happen at any time during waking hours. If the behaviour of interest varies, this needs to be considered in both types of research.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Probably the most obvious time of day effect is the sleep-wake cycle. Unless you&rsquo;re studying sleep, it&rsquo;s best to collect data when an individual is awake and alert. For diurnal humans that&rsquo;s the day but most rodents are nocturnal meaning they&rsquo;re active at night. &nbsp;This introduces an important consideration when using non-human animals like rats to model human processes, but many studies test rats during the light phase, when they&rsquo;re least alert. Of course it&rsquo;s difficult to work with rats in the dark, so one solution is to house animals on a reverse light-dark cycle, so their active time matches the researchers&rsquo;s schd. Dim red light provides low illumination to mimic night but allows researchers to see. Tests of humans are usually done during the day, but there are variations in behaviour, alertness, and activity from early morning to evening </span><span class="c0">(May et al, 1993).</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">The best way scientifically to deal with participant differences across the day would be to collect data over a 24 hour period. Of course, it&#39;s not usually possible to test human participants around the clock, and it requires specialized equipment and procedures to do this in animals. The most feasible approach for researchers is to be aware of whether there is a known time of day effect for their variable of interest so that an informed decision can be used in choosing the testing time.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/oZKt_iaugvI&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586681738&amp;usg=AOvVaw2KiSTjN3R8gwEA6IXahab5">Time of Day Effects video</a></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.tlfgn6h7r22y"><span class="c31 c41">Key Takeaways</span></h3><ul class="c8 lst-kix_tnnw5m79u4p4-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Psychological researchers do not simply assume that their measures work.

This type of design doesn&rsquo;t manipulate variables to create different conditions, nor does it attempt to find relationships between measured variables. In fact, a descriptive research design is the only one that can be done on a single variable (Siedlecki, 2000) although researchers usually collect many. We&rsquo;ll consider three different approaches to descriptive research.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.u184loxrmkai"><span>5.1 </span><span class="c6">Case Studies</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Case studies are a special type of descriptive research design that provide in-depth information about an unusual or atypical individual or group. Because they use very small numbers of participants, sometimes just a single person, case studies are vulnerable to experimenter and participant bias. Despite this, we can learn a lot from them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The most famous case study in psychology and neuroscience is the study of HM &lsquo;s memory deficits by Brenda Milner. HM had both his medial temporal lobes removed as a last resort treatment for recurrent seizures. Although his seizures declined, he suffered from a permanent, selective type of amnesia. His pre-surgery memories were intact and he could learn new motor tasks, but he couldn&rsquo;t form any new explicit memories. Brenda Milner used different types of cognitive tests to assess the specific nature of his memory deficits and to distinguish separate memory systems in the brain </span><span class="c4">(Scoville &amp; Milner, 1957) and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;spawned a whole new field, cognitive neuroscience. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Although HM could not lay down any new explicit memories, like remembering who Brenda Milner was, he could learn new implicit tasks, like the mirror tracing task shown in </span><span class="c4">Figure 5.1</span><span class="c4">, where you have to trace between the lines of this image by looking at your hand with a mirror. Although he had no recollection of doing it, his performance improved over several days, indicating that he formed a new memory (</span><span class="c4">Milner </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 1968)</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 358.96px; height: 324.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 358.96px; height: 324.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Figure 5.1: Mirror drawing task used to test implicit memory.

HM died in 2008 at the age of 82, and his name was finally revealed, Henry Molaison. Always a willing research participant, he donated his brain to the Brain Observatory in San Diego, where it was sectioned into 2041 ultra thin sections (</span><span class="c4">The Brain Observatory, nd</span><span class="c4">).

Thus naturalistic observation is a type of field research, rather than laboratory research. It could involve observing shoppers in a grocery store, children on a school playground, or migrating birds. Researchers usually make their observations as unobtrusively as possible so that participants aren&rsquo;t aware they&rsquo;re being studied. In non-human animals, the presence of humans in the wild could disrupt feeding or alert predators, potentially endangering the research subjects of interest. In research with humans, this isn&rsquo;t usually a problem but people do have an expectation of privacy that non-humans don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Ethically, naturalistic observation is considered acceptable if participants remain anonymous and behaviour occurs in a public setting where people wouldn&rsquo;t normally have an expectation of privacy. Grocery shoppers putting items into their shopping carts, for example, are engaged in public behaviour that is easily observable by store employees and other shoppers. Behaviour in a public bathroom is a different story altogether, most people don&rsquo;t expect, or appreciate, being watched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Researchers Robert Levine and Ara Norenzayan used naturalistic observation to study differences in the &ldquo;pace of life&rdquo; across countries </span><span class="c4">(Levine &amp; Norenzayan, 1999)</span><span class="c0">. One of their measures involved observing pedestrians in a large city to see how long it took them to walk 60 feet. They found that people in some countries walked reliably faster than in other countries. For example, people in the United States and Japan covered 60 feet in about 12 seconds on average, while people in Brazil and Romania took close to 17 seconds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because naturalistic observation takes place in the complex and even chaotic &ldquo;real world,&rdquo; there are two closely related issues that researchers must deal with before collecting data. The first is sampling. When, where, and under what conditions will the observations be made, and who exactly will be observed? Levine and Norenzayan described their sampling process as follows:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Male and female walking speed over a distance of 60 feet was measured in at least two locations in main downtown areas in each city. Measurements were taken during main business hours on clear summer days. All locations were flat, unobstructed, had broad sidewalks, and were sufficiently uncrowded to allow pedestrians to move at potentially maximum speeds. To control for the effects of socializing, only pedestrians walking alone were used. Children, individuals with obvious physical handicaps, and window-shoppers were not timed. Thirty-five men and 35 women were timed in most cities.&rdquo; (p. 186)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Precise specification of the sampling process in this way makes data collection manageable for the observers, and it also provides some control over important extraneous variables. For example, by making their observations on clear summer days in all countries, Levine and Norenzayan controlled for effects of the weather on people&rsquo;s walking speeds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The second issue is measurement. What specific behaviors will be observed? In Levine and Norenzayan&rsquo;s study, measurement was relatively straightforward. They simply measured out a 60-foot distance along a city sidewalk and then used a stopwatch to time participants as they walked over that distance. Often, however, the behaviors of interest are not so obvious or objective. For example, researchers Robert Kraut and Robert Johnston wanted to study bowlers&rsquo; reactions to their shots, both when they were facing the pins and then when they turned toward their companions </span><span class="c4">(Kraut &amp; Johnston, 1979)</span><span class="c0">. But what &ldquo;reactions&rdquo; should they observe? Based on previous research and their own pilot testing, Kraut and Johnston created a list of reactions that included &ldquo;closed smile,&rdquo; &ldquo;open smile,&rdquo; &ldquo;laugh,&rdquo; &ldquo;neutral face,&rdquo; &ldquo;look down,&rdquo; &ldquo;look away,&rdquo; and &ldquo;face cover&rdquo; (covering one&rsquo;s face with one&rsquo;s hands). The observers committed this list to memory and then practiced by coding the reactions of bowlers who had been videotaped. During the actual study, the observers spoke into an audio recorder, describing the reactions they observed. Among the most interesting results of this study was that bowlers rarely smiled while they still faced the pins. They were much more likely to smile after they turned toward their companions, suggesting that smiling is not purely an expression of happiness but also a form of social communication.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">When the observations require a judgment on the part of the observers&mdash;as in Kraut and Johnston&rsquo;s study&mdash;this process is often described as </span><span class="c10 c4">coding</span><span class="c4">. Coding requires clearly defining a set of target behaviors so</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;different observers code them in the same way. The observers then watch participants for these pre-defined behaviours and count their frequency and, if relevant, time their duration. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Good operational definitions are crucial for this type of research so it&rsquo;s standard practice to report the inter-rater reliability of the coding procedure used. This is done by having multiple raters code the same behaviors independently and then showing that the different observers agree. Kraut and Johnston, for example, video-recorded a subset of their participants&rsquo; reactions and had two observers independently code them. The two observers agreed 97% of the time, indicating excellent inter-rater reliability.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/bRuYpxPZvE8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586702081&amp;usg=AOvVaw0yKo5CeP3tcryaTUvFakDn">Naturalistic Observation video</a></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.daqy30sz4mnf"><span>5.3 </span><span class="c6">Archival Data and Remote Research</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Another approach to descriptive research is the use of </span><span class="c10 c4">archival data</span><span class="c4">, which has already been collected for some other purpose. An example is a study by Brett Pelham and his colleagues on &ldquo;implicit egotism&rdquo;&mdash;the tendency for people to prefer people, places, and things that are similar to themselves </span><span class="c4">(Pelham, Carvallo, &amp; Jones, 2005)</span><span class="c0">. In one study, they examined Social Security records in the US to show that women with the names Virginia, Georgia, Louise, and Florence were especially likely to have moved to the states of Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana, and Florida!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Content analysis</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the study of documents and other types of communication, like photos or speeches, and is the cornerstone of archival research. Just as naturalistic observation requires specifying the behaviors of interest and then noting them as they occur, content analysis requires specifying keywords, phrases, or ideas and then finding all occurrences of them in the data. These occurrences can then be analyzed to see how they change over time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One example using this approach evaluated representations of mental illness in over 24,000 news articles published in 20 high circulation Canadian news outlets from 2005-2011. Over this time period, stigmatizing language and negative portrayal decreased while reporting about the need for mental health supports increased. Negative portrayals of mental illness were more likely in tabloid newspapers compared to broadsheet or online publications (Whitely &amp; Wang, 2017). Although this type of research can&rsquo;t tell us about individuals&rsquo; behaviour, it can provide a glimpse of larger scale changes over time. The appearance of news topics and the number of reads, likes, and reshares can tell us what large groups of people are thinking about.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">Like archival research, </span><span class="c10 c4">remote research</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;involves collecting data from participants without ever having to meet them. In research with humans, this can be done easily online, especially for self-report data. Before the advent of the Internet, sampling behaviour </span><span class="c0">remotely usually involved some sort of device, like a pager or activity tracker. Nowadays, phones and wearable devices like fitbits monitor activity levels and heart rate, so are increasingly used in place of specialized devices. In animal behaviour studies, remote research is called telemetry or biologging, and is used extensively in the study of animals in the wild. Because animals don&rsquo;t have phones whose data we can access, procedures are necessary to attach tags to the animals, which can be challenging for birds or aquatic animals like whales and seals.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/sxHSwNuN5to&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586706434&amp;usg=AOvVaw34oUcBGKTMbAhyYFQM9Sco">Remote Research video</a></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.dr96g6aznx4k"><span class="c6">Key Takeaways</span></h2><ul class="c8 lst-kix_jq2ucwjkgtcv-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Descriptive research aims to characterize behaviour and is the only research design that can be done on a single variable</span></li><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Case studies allow for in-depth study of a rare event or group but are vulnerable to expectancy biases and poor generalizability</span></li><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Naturalistic observation collects data from individuals in their natural environment so has high ecological validity.

There are two main reasons researchers would choose to conduct a correlational study rather than an experiment. The first is that they do not believe that the statistical relationship is a causal one, meaning that one variable is responsible for creating a change in a second variable. For instance, scores on the 10-item Edinburgh Handedness Inventory are strongly correlated with the longer 15-item augmented version, but neither </span><span class="c0">test score is thought to cause the other. A strong correlation indicates that these measures are likely measuring the same construct (handedness).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Another reason</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;researchers choose to use a correlational study rather than an experiment is when the statistical relationship of interest is thought to be causal, but the researcher cannot manipulate the independent variable because it is impossible, impractical, or unethical. For example, Allen Kanner and his colleagues thought that the number of &ldquo;daily hassles&rdquo; (e.g., rude salespeople, heavy traffic) that people experience affects the number of physical and psychological symptoms they have (Kanner </span><span class="c3">et al.,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;1981). But because they could not manipulate the number of daily hassles their participants experienced, they had to settle for measuring the number of daily hassles and the number of symptoms using self-report questionnaires. Although the strong positive relationship they found between these two variables is consistent with their idea that hassles cause symptoms, it is also consistent with the idea that symptoms cause hassles or that some third variable (e.g., poverty) causes both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">These examples, scores on a handedness questionnaire or the number of daily hassles involve two quantitative variables. However, correlational research can also be done on categorical variables. Imagine, for example, that a researcher administers the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory to 50 university students and 50 community college students. Although this </span><span class="c3">feels</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;like a between-subjects experiment with clear comparison groups, the researcher did </span><span class="c3">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;manipulate the schools the students attended so this example is more likely a correlational design.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Consider a hypothetical study on the relationship between whether people make a daily to-do and psychological stress. It&rsquo;s unclear whether this is an experiment or a correlational study because we don&rsquo;t know whether the independent variable was manipulated. If the researcher randomly assigned some participants to make daily to-do lists and others not to, then it&rsquo;s an</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">experiment. If the researcher simply asked participants whether they made daily to-do lists, then it&rsquo;s a correlational study. The distinction is important because if the study was an experiment, then it could be concluded that making the daily to-do lists affected participants&rsquo; stress. But if it was a correlational study, it could only be concluded that these variables are statistically related. Perhaps being stressed has a negative effect on people&rsquo;s ability to plan ahead (the directionality problem). Or perhaps people who are more conscientious are more likely to make to-do lists and less likely to be stressed (the third-variable problem). The crucial point is that what defines a study as experimental or correlational is not the variables being studied, nor whether the variables are quantitative or categorical, nor the type of graph or statistics used to analyze the data, it&rsquo;s how the study is conducted.</span></p><h3 class="c52 c15" id="h.fn52jbflo8y9"><span class="c31 c41">6.1.1 Assessing Relationships Among Multiple Variables</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most complex correlational research involves measuring several variables, sometimes both categorical and quantitative, and then assessing the statistical relationships among them. One social media analysis study examined Rate My Professor ratings for 407 criminal justice and criminology professors sampled from 10 US states (Johnson &amp; Crews, 2013). They compared the standard 5-point ratings for easiness, clarity, helpfulness, and overall quality on the Rate My Professor platform as well as chili peppers, used as a categorical rating of hotness. They also collected information from online biographies about their years of experience, presumed gender and ethnicity, professional experience, and number of publications. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The results of this study are summarized in a correlation matrix in Table 6.1, showing the correlation (Pearson&rsquo;s r) between every possible pair of variables in the study. They found that, with the exception of hotness, Rate My Professor variables were all strongly correlated with each other (Table 6.1). For instance, analysis of professor clarity and helpfulness yielded a Pearson&rsquo;s r value of +0.89, while clarity and easiness was a bit lower at +0.53. When compared to the bibliographic data, clarity was weakly correlated with being White and male, with r values of +0.22 and +0.11 respectively. Comparing correlations between pairs of variables is called </span><span class="c10 c4">bivariate analysis</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(note that the </span><span class="c0">correlation between a variable and itself is always +1.00).</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Table 6.1 Correlation matrix among the Rate My Professor ratings and personal characteristics.

In essence, factor analysis organizes the variables into a smaller number of clusters, such that they are strongly correlated within each cluster but weakly correlated between clusters. Each cluster is then interpreted as multiple measures of the same underlying construct. These underlying constructs are also called </span><span class="c10 c4">factors</span><span class="c0">. One study asked more than 1,700 university students to rate how much they liked 14 different popular genres of music (Rentfrow &amp; Gosling, 2008). They then submitted these 14 variables to a factor analysis, which identified four distinct factors. The researchers called them Reflective and Complex (blues, jazz, classical, and folk), Intense and Rebellious (rock, alternative, and heavy metal), Upbeat and Conventional (country, soundtrack, religious, pop), and Energetic and Rhythmic (rap/hip-hop, soul/funk, and electronica).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Two additional points about factor analysis are worth making here. One is that factors are not categories. Factor analysis does not tell us that people like either &ldquo;reflective and complex&rdquo; music or &ldquo;intense and rebellious&rdquo; music. Instead, factors are constructs that operate independently of each other. So people who like reflective and complex music might or might not also like intense and rebellious music. The second point is that factor analysis reveals only the underlying structure of the variables. It is up to researchers to interpret and label the factors and to </span><span class="c5">explain the origin of that particular factor structure. </span></p><h3 class="c52 c15" id="h.4pop6jbiwf9"><span>6.1.2 Exploring Causal Relationships </span></h3><p class="c22"><span class="c4">Another important use of complex correlational research is to explore possible causal relationships among variables. This might seem surprising given that everyone knows that correlation does not imply causation! It&rsquo;s true that correlational research cannot definitively establish that one variable causes another. Complex correlational research, however, can often be used to rule out other plausible interpretations.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dit5P9b086jk%26t%3D1s&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586723395&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TXJWJU_Yrqnw0Hxub_Xt1">Exploring Causation video</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The primary way of doing this is through the statistical control of potential third variables. Instead of controlling these variables by random assignment or by holding them constant as in an experiment, the researcher measures them and includes them in the statistical analysis. Consider some research by Paul Piff and his colleagues, who hypothesized that being lower in socioeconomic status (SES) causes people to be more generous (Piff </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c0">2011). They measured their participants&rsquo; SES and had them play the dictator game. They told participants that each would be paired with another participant in a different room, but in reality, there was no other participant. Then they gave each participant 10 points, which could later be converted to money, to split with the partner in whatever way they decided. Because the participants were the dictators, they could even keep all 10 points for themselves if they wanted to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As predicted, participants who were lower in SES tended to give away more of their points than participants who were higher, consistent with the idea that being lower in SES causes people to be more generous. But there are also plausible third variables that could explain this relationship. It could be that people who are lower in SES tend to be more religious and that it is their greater religiosity that causes them to be more generous. Or it could be that people who are lower in SES tend to come from ethnic groups that emphasize generosity more than other ethnic groups. The researchers dealt with these potential third variables, however, by measuring them and including them in their statistical analyses. They found that neither religiosity nor ethnicity was correlated with generosity and were therefore able to rule them out as third variables. This does not prove that SES causes greater generosity because there could still be other third variables that the researchers did not measure. But by ruling out some of the most plausible third variables, the researchers made a stronger case for SES as the cause of the greater generosity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Many studies of this type use a statistical technique called </span><span class="c10 c4">multiple regression.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This involves measuring several predictor variables, x1, x2, x3,&hellip;xi, which are possible causes of a single outcome variable, y. The result of a multiple regression analysis is an equation that expresses the outcome variable as an additive combination of the predictors. This regression equation has the following general form: b1x1+ b2x2+ b3x3+ &hellip; + bixi= Y. The quantities b1, b2, and so on are </span><span class="c10 c4">regression weights</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that indicate how large a contribution a predictor variable makes, on average, to the outcome variable. So the larger the b value in front of predictor variable x, the stronger its predictive ability. Sometimes the terms </span><span class="c3">independent</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">dependent</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are used to describe predictor and outcome variables, respectively, but these terms are also used to describe manipulated and measured variables in experiments. To avoid confusion, we&rsquo;ll use the terms predictor and outcome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The advantage of multiple regression is that it can show whether a predictor variable makes a contribution to an outcome variable over and above the contributions made by other predictors. As a hypothetical example, imagine that a researcher wants to know how the predictor variables of income and health relate to the outcome variable of happiness. This is tricky because income</span><span class="c36">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">and health are themselves related to each other. Thus if people with greater incomes tend to be happier, then perhaps this is only because they tend to be healthier. Likewise, if people who are healthier tend to be happier, perhaps this is only because they tend to make more money. But a multiple regression analysis including both income and happiness as predictor variables would show whether each one makes a contribution to happiness when the other is taken into account. Research like this, by the way, has shown both income and health make extremely small contributions to happiness except in the case of severe poverty or illness (Diener, 2000).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The examples discussed in this section only scratch the surface of how researchers use complex correlational research to explore possible causal relationships among variables. It is important to keep in mind, however, that purely correlational approaches cannot unambiguously establish that one variable causes another. The best they can do is show patterns of relationships that are consistent with some causal interpretations and inconsistent with others.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.ahzmff2qec67"><span class="c6">6.2 Survey Research</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Survey research is a quantitative approach that has two important characteristics. First, the variables of interest are measured using self-reports. Survey researchers ask participants, usually called respondents, to report directly on their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Second, considerable attention is paid to the issue of sampling. Survey researchers have a strong preference for large random samples because they provide the most accurate estimates of the true population. In fact, survey research may be the only approach in psychology in which random sampling is routinely used. Beyond these two characteristics, almost anything goes in survey research. Surveys can be long or short. They can be conducted in person, by telephone, through the mail, or online. They can be about voting intentions, consumer preferences, social attitudes, health, or anything else that it is possible to ask people about and receive meaningful answers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Most survey research is non-experimental. It&rsquo;s used to describe single variables, like the percentage of voters who prefer a &nbsp;candidate or the prevalence of schizophrenia in the general population and also to assess statistical relationships between variables, like the relationship between income and health. But surveys can also be experimental. </span><span class="c4 c26">.</span></p><h3 class="c15 c52" id="h.g48gjahs9nsr"><span class="c31 c41">6.2.1 Constructing Survey Questionnaires</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The heart of any survey research project is the survey questionnaire itself. Although it&rsquo;s easy to think of interesting questions to ask people, constructing a good survey questionnaire is not. The problem is that the answers people give can be influenced in unintended ways by the wording of the items, the order of the items, the response options provided, and many other factors. At best, these influences add noise to the data. At worst, they result in systematic biases and misleading results. In this section, therefore, we consider some principles for constructing survey questionnaires to minimize these unintended effects and thereby maximize the reliability and validity of respondents&rsquo; answers. Consider the following questionnaire item:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How many alcoholic drinks do you consume in a typical day?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">_____ a lot more than average</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">_____ somewhat more than average</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">_____ average</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">_____ somewhat fewer than average</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">_____ a lot fewer than average</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although this item at first seems straightforward, it poses several difficulties for respondents. First, they must interpret the question. For example, they must decide whether &ldquo;alcoholic drinks&rdquo; include beer and wine (as opposed to just hard liquor) and whether a &ldquo;typical day&rdquo; is a typical weekday, typical weekend day, or both. Once they have interpreted the question, they must retrieve relevant information from memory to answer it. But what information should they retrieve, and how should they go about retrieving it? They might think vaguely about some recent occasions on which they drank alcohol, they might carefully try to recall and count the number of alcoholic drinks they consumed last week, or they might retrieve some existing beliefs that they have about themselves (e.g., &ldquo;I am not much of a drinker&rdquo;). Then they must use this information to arrive at a tentative judgment about how many alcoholic drinks they consume in a typical day. For example, this might mean dividing the number of alcoholic drinks they consumed last week by seven to come up with an average number per day. Then they must format this tentative answer in terms of the response options actually provided. In this case, the options pose additional problems of interpretation. For example, what does &ldquo;average&rdquo; mean, and what would count as &ldquo;somewhat more&rdquo; than average? Finally, they must decide whether they want to report the response they have come up with or whether they want to edit it in some way. For example, if they believe that they drink much more than average, they might not want to report this for fear of looking bad in the eyes of the researcher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From this perspective, what at first appears to be a simple matter of asking people how much they drink (and receiving a straightforward answer from them) turns out to be much more complex.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.f4kqr9i1onpi"><span class="c31 c41">6.2.2 Writing Survey Questionnaire Items</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Questionnaire items can be either open-ended or closed-ended. Open-ended items simply ask a question and allow participants to answer in whatever way they choose. The following are examples of open-ended questionnaire items.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is the most important thing to teach children to prepare them for life?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please describe a time when you were discriminated against because of your age.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Open-ended items are useful when researchers do not know how participants might respond or want to avoid influencing their responses. They tend to be used when researchers have more vaguely defined research questions&mdash;often in the early stages of a research project. Open-ended items are relatively easy to write because there are no response options to worry about. However, they take more time and effort on the part of participants, and they are more difficult for the researcher to analyze because the answers must be transcribed, coded, and submitted to some form of content analysis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Closed-ended items ask a question and provide a set of response options for participants to choose from. The alcohol item just mentioned is an example, as are the following:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">How old are you?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">_____ Under 18</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">_____ 18 to 34</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">_____ 35 to 49</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">_____ 50 to 70</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">_____ Over 70</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">On a scale of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst pain ever experienced), how much pain are you in right now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Closed-ended items are used when researchers have a good idea of the different responses that participants might make. They are also used when researchers are interested in a well-defined variable or construct such as participants&rsquo; level of agreement with some statement, perceptions of risk, or frequency of a particular behavior. Closed-ended items are more difficult to write because they must include an appropriate set of response options. However, they are relatively quick and easy for participants to complete. They are also much easier for researchers to analyze because the responses can be easily converted to numbers and entered into a spreadsheet. For these reasons, closed-ended items are much more common.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All closed-ended items include a set of response options from which a participant must choose. For categorical variables like gender, race, or political preference, the categories are usually listed and participants choose the one (or ones) that they belong to. For quantitative variables, a rating scale is typically provided. A rating scale is an ordered set of responses that participants must choose from.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In reading about psychological research, you are likely to encounter the term Likert scale. Although this term is sometimes used to refer to almost any rating scale (e.g., a 0-to-10 life satisfaction scale), it has a much more precise meaning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the 1930s, researcher Rensis Likert (pronounced LICK-ert) created a new approach for measuring people&rsquo;s attitudes (Likert, 1932). It involves presenting people with several statements&mdash;including both favorable and unfavorable statements&mdash;about some person, group, or idea. Respondents then express their agreement or disagreement with each statement on a 5-point scale: Strongly Agree, Agree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. Numbers are assigned to each response and then summed across all items to produce a score representing the attitude toward the person, group, or idea. The entire set of items came to be called a Likert scale. Thus unless you are measuring people&rsquo;s attitude toward something by assessing their level of agreement with several statements about it, it is best to avoid calling it a Likert scale. You are probably just using a &ldquo;rating scale.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">We can now consider some principles of writing questionnaire items that minimize unintended context effects and maximize the reliability and validity of participants&rsquo; responses. A rough guideline for writing questionnaire items is provided by the BRUSO model (Peterson, 2000). An acronym, BRUSO stands for &ldquo;brief,&rdquo; &ldquo;relevant,&rdquo; &ldquo;unambiguous,&rdquo; &ldquo;specific,&rdquo; and &ldquo;objective.&rdquo; Effective questionnaire items are brief and to the point. They avoid long, overly technical, or unnecessary words. This makes them easier for respondents to understand and faster for them to complete. Effective questionnaire items are also relevant to the research question. If a respondent&rsquo;s sexual orientation, marital status, or income is not relevant, then items on them should probably not be included. Again, this makes the questionnaire faster to complete, but it also avoids annoying respondents with what they will rightly perceive as irrelevant or even &ldquo;nosy&rdquo; questions. Effective questionnaire items are also unambiguous; they can be interpreted in only one way. Part of the problem with the alcohol item presented earlier in this section is that different respondents might have different ideas about what constitutes &ldquo;an alcoholic drink&rdquo; or &ldquo;a typical day.&rdquo; Effective questionnaire items are also specific, so that it is clear to respondents what their response should be about and clear to researchers what it is about. A common problem here is closed-ended items that are &ldquo;double barreled.&rdquo; They ask about two conceptually separate issues but allow only one response. For example, &ldquo;Please rate the extent to which you have been feeling anxious and depressed.&rdquo; This item should probably be split into two separate items&mdash;one about anxiety and one about depression. </span><span class="c4">Finally, effective questionnaire items are objective in the sense that they do not reveal the researcher&rsquo;s own opinions or lead participants to answer in a particular way. </span><span class="c0">Table 6.2 shows some examples of poor and effective questionnaire items based on the BRUSO criteria.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Table 6.2 BRUSO model of writing effective questionnaire Items, with examples</span></p><table class="c55"><tr class="c45"><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">B&mdash;Brief</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you now or have you ever been the possessor of a bicycle?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you ever owned a pedal bike?&rdquo;</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c35"><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">R&mdash;Relevant</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is your sexual orientation?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t include this item unless it is clearly relevant to the research.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c35"><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">U&mdash;Unambiguous</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c54"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you a gun person?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c54"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you currently own a gun?&rdquo;</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c35"><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">S&mdash;Specific</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c54"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How much have you read about the new gun control measure and sales tax?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12 c69"><span class="c0"></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c35"><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">O&mdash;Objective</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How much do you support the legalization of vaping?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></td><td class="c43" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c22"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is your view of the new e-cigarette legislation?&rdquo;</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For closed-ended items, it is also important to create an appropriate response scale. For categorical variables, the categories presented should generally be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Mutually exclusive categories do not overlap. For a religion item, for example, the categories of Christian and Catholic are not mutually exclusive but Protestant and Catholic are. Exhaustive categories cover all possible responses. Although Protestant and Catholic are mutually exclusive, they are not exhaustive because there are many other religious categories that a respondent might select: Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, etc. Sometimes it&rsquo;s not feasible to include every possible category, in which case an Other category, with a space for the respondent to fill in a more specific response, is a good solution. If respondents could belong to more than one category (e.g., ethnicity), they should be instructed to choose all categories that apply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">For rating scales, five or seven response options generally allow about as much precision as respondents are capable of. However, numerical scales with more options can sometimes be appropriate. For dimensions such as attractiveness, pain, and likelihood, a 0-to-10 scale will be</span><span class="c36">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">familiar to many respondents and easy for them to use. Regardless of the number of response options, the most extreme ones should generally be balanced around a neutral or modal midpoint. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/f312STkw0R0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586749980&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Yh-EKBCfFkCz8WoB3bWSt">Surveys recording</a></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.nt8ga6yfc1v4"><span class="c6">Key Takeaways</span></h2><ul class="c8 lst-kix_xbx6evgz26tx-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Researchers often use complex correlational research to explore relationships among several variables in the same study.</span></li><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Complex correlational research can be used to explore possible causal relationships among variables using techniques such as multiple regression, but they cannot unambiguously establish that one variable causes another.</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_6tuynlro1d3c-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Survey research is a quantitative approach that features the use of self-report measures on carefully selected samples.</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_ckkupvh65140-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Survey questionnaire items are either open-ended or closed-ended.

Laboratories are found in a variety of settings such as schools, universities, &nbsp;museums, physicians&#39; offices, clinics, hospitals, corporate research and testing facilities, government regulatory and forensic investigation centers, and privately owned research institutions. Laboratory setup and equipment are determined by the requirements of the specialists working there: a physics lab might have a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber, while a psychologist&#39;s lab might contain video recording equipment to observe behavior (Laboratory, 2025).. </span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.7uw6oobsnqnl"><span>7.1 </span><span class="c6">Research Settings</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Research settings in psychology and neuroscience can vary a lot depending upon the research question, participants, techniques required, and cost. We&rsquo;ll consider two broad categories of research setting, the field and the laboratory. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Certain types of animal behaviour research can&rsquo;t be done in a laboratory setting, like migration routes and mating patterns of large animals. Therefore some studies collect data in the field, the natural environment of the individual of interest. Field research is heavily used in ares that span psychology and biology including, </span><span class="c10 c4">ethology</span><span class="c4">, the scientific study of animal behaviour (Ethology, 2025), and </span><span class="c10 c4">ecology</span><span class="c0">, the study of the interaction of living beings with their environment (Ecology, 2025)). However, field research is not restricted to non-humans, since we have natural environments too!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can find people in all habitable spaces on Earth, so field research in humans can happen in all sorts of unusual locations. Workplaces, shopping malls, schools, and hospitals are all real world locations where researchers observe natural behaviour. &nbsp;Observation is typically done in public places without interacting with the participants, like the study on pace of life in different countries by Levine &amp; Norenzayan (1999). One of the main measures taken was walking speed, based on how long it took people to walk a 60 foot stretch on a city sidewalk, collected from a distance without bothering them. They found the fastest city walkers in Switzerland and the slowest in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">&#8203;&#8203;David Rosenhan&rsquo;s famous study with his &ldquo;pseudopatients&rdquo; could be considered a field study (Rosenhan, 1973). He was interested in diagnosis, but he didn&rsquo;t simply observe from a public place like the previous studies. His pseudopatients were confederates who falsely reported hearing voices, and all ended up admitted to hospital. So is this really field research? Given that diagnosis of mental illness happens in a medical setting, observing the behaviour of mental health providers is best done in this setting. So this is an unusual field study where confederates and deception were used. Another consideration for field research in humans is the growing use of online questionnaires. If a participant decides to complete the survey, the researcher has no control whatsoever over the environment where the data is collected.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">Most people picture a</span><span class="c10 c4">&nbsp;laboratory</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as a space for specialized equipment operated by highly trained people. This is almost always the case for the physical sciences like chemistry and physics and life sciences like biology and neuroscience. However many psychologists can get all the data they need with some participants, software, and a quiet place to click on a keyboard. Cognitive psychologists rely heavily on computer-based tasks to present stimuli and collect responses, so the research setting needs to allow for this to happen. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">Regardless of the specific requirements of the research, the biggest advantage to research in the lab is control. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why experiments, which require much more control than descriptive and correlational studies, are typically done in labs rather than in the field. </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">A laboratory is necessary for research using special techniques, human brain imaging is an obvious example of this. &nbsp;Pretty well all neuroscience research on non-human animals is carried out in a lab, sometimes in several specialized spaces, one to measure animal behaviour and another to analyze changes in the brain. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">Sometimes laboratory equipment is used as part of deception, like Milgram&rsquo;s fake shock generator. Using props like this in a laboratory setting promotes obedience, as we know from Milgram&rsquo;s shocking findings (Milgram, 1963). &nbsp;From this and other research, it&rsquo;s clear that human research volunteers are surprisingly willing to do things they don&rsquo;t want to, which makes it difficult to study &ldquo;natural&rdquo; tendencies, so researchers have come up with interesting ways to study &ldquo;natural&rdquo; behaviour in a laboratory setting. Consider the Stanford Prison, which is considered one of the most unethical experiments in psychology because the researchers did not halt the study when it was clear participants experienced harm. The study started innocently enough, 75 men were recruited from the community to participate in a study on prison life. They completed a battery of questionnaires and were interviewed by one of the researchers in order to get a sample with strong mental and physical health and no previous involvement in crime. Then they were randomly assigned to be either prisoners or guards for six days in a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; prison in the basement of a university building (Haney </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 19</span><span class="c0">. The intention was to run the experiment for two weeks, but for reasons now well known, it was called off after 6 days because the prisoners were treated so badly. So what was the research setting like for these participants?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14 c33"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">The guards were given uniforms to wear and wore mirrored sunglasses, making it impossible for prisoners to make eye contact. They were also given other items associated with a prison guard, like keys and a whistle. The prisoners wore plain smocks with no underwear and slept in a small room converted to look like a cell. The guards were told to maintain order within the prison to keep it functioning for 8 hour shifts, whereas the prisoners lived in this simulated prison the whole time. Initially prisoners and guards got along fine, but things deteriorated very quickly to the point where guards abused the &ldquo;prisoners&rdquo;, some of whom had real emotional breakdowns. What was it about this lab setting that promoted this type of behaviour from the guards? They knew they were role playing, the researchers told them so from the outset. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">One major contributing factor was that the researchers allowed the experiment to continue even though participants experienced real harm. The ethical conduct of the researcher is also part of the research setting, and it can have a huge effect on behaviour, as shown by this study and others, like Milgram&rsquo;s study of obedience. &nbsp;Research settings must be carefully chosen to meet the needs of the research question, but they must also consider the welfare of the participants. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/UCmyiwZP9qM&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586765605&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ULjQNF6F5PXC7TF4Khzoc">Research Settings video</a></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.6eyk57q54sk9"><span class="c6">7.2 Carryover Effects and Counterbalancing</span></h2><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.5vg7k7l5ixtl"><span class="c19">7.2.1 Within-Subjects Experiments</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a within-subjects experiment, each participant is tested under all conditions. Consider an experiment on the effect of a defendant&rsquo;s physical attractiveness on judgments of guilt. In a between-subjects experiment, one group of participants would be shown an attractive defendant and asked to judge their guilt, and another group of participants would be shown an unattractive defendant and asked to judge their guilt. In a within-subjects experiment, however, the same group of participants would judge the guilt of both an attractive and an unattractive defendant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The primary advantage of this approach is that it provides maximum control of extraneous participant variables. Participants in all conditions have the same mean socioeconomic status, same number of siblings, and so on&mdash;because they are the very same people. Within-subjects experiments also make it possible to use statistical procedures that remove the effect of these extraneous participant variables on the dependent variable and therefore make the data less &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; and the effect of the independent variable easier to detect. We will look more closely at this idea later in the book.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The primary disadvantage of within-subjects designs is that they can result in carryover effects. A carryover effect is an effect of being tested in one condition on participants&rsquo; behavior in later conditions. One type of carryover effect is a </span><span class="c10 c4">practice effect</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;where participants perform a task better in later conditions because they have had a chance to practice it. Another type is a </span><span class="c10 c4">fatigue effect</span><span class="c4">, where participants perform a task worse in later conditions because they become tired or bored. Being tested in one condition can also change how participants perceive stimuli or interpret their task in later conditions. This is called a </span><span class="c10 c4">context effect</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;For example, an average-looking defendant might be judged more harshly when participants have just judged an attractive defendant than when they have just judged an unattractive defendant. Within-subjects experiments also make it easier for participants to guess the hypothesis. For example, a participant who is asked to judge the guilt of an attractive defendant and then is asked to judge the guilt of an unattractive defendant is likely to guess that the hypothesis is that defendant attractiveness affects judgments of guilt. This could lead the participant to judge the unattractive defendant more harshly because he thinks this is what he is expected to do. Or it could make participants judge the two defendants similarly in an effort to be &ldquo;fair.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carryover effects can be interesting in their own right, but when they are not the focus of the research, carryover effects can be problematic. Imagine, for example, that participants judge the guilt of an attractive defendant and then judge the guilt of an unattractive defendant. If they judge the unattractive defendant more harshly, this might be because of his unattractiveness. But it could be instead that they judge him more harshly because they are becoming bored or tired. In other words, the order of the conditions is a confounding variable. The attractive condition is always the first condition and the unattractive condition the second. Thus any difference between the conditions in terms of the dependent variable could be caused by the order of the conditions and not the independent variable itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a solution to the problem of order effects, however, that can be used in many situations. It is counterbalancing, which means testing different participants in different orders. For example, some participants would be tested in the attractive defendant condition followed by the unattractive defendant condition, and others would be tested in the unattractive condition followed by the attractive condition. With three conditions, there would be six different orders (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA), so some participants would be tested in each of the six orders. With counterbalancing, participants are assigned to orders randomly, so random assignment plays an important role in within-subjects designs just as in between-subjects designs. Here, instead of randomly assigning to conditions, they are randomly assigned to different orders of conditions. In fact, it can safely be said that if a study does not involve random assignment in one form or another, it is not a true experiment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are two ways to think about what counterbalancing accomplishes. One is that it controls the order of conditions so that it is no longer a confounding variable. Instead of the attractive condition always being first and the unattractive condition always being second, the attractive condition comes first for some participants and second for others. Likewise, the unattractive condition comes first for some participants and second for others. Thus any overall difference in the dependent variable between the two conditions cannot have been caused by the order of conditions. A second way to think about what counterbalancing accomplishes is that if there are carryover effects, it makes it possible to detect them. One can analyze the data separately for each order to see whether it had an effect.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/mQ3HpKbNFCc&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586774052&amp;usg=AOvVaw1P7QdhSzIwLxHKatjeOL9j">Carryover Effects video</a></span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.2d4cx0gy3pz8"><span class="c19">7.2.2 Simultaneous Within-Subjects Designs</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">So far, we have discussed an approach to within-subjects designs in which participants are tested in one condition at a time. There is another approach, however, that is often used when participants make multiple responses in each condition. Imagine, for example, that participants judge the guilt of 10 attractive defendants and 10 unattractive defendants. Instead of having people make judgments about all 10 defendants of one type followed by all 10 defendants of the other type, the researcher could present all 20 defendants in a sequence that mixed the two types. The researcher could then compute each participant&rsquo;s mean rating for each type of defendant. Or imagine an experiment designed to see whether people with social anxiety disorder remember negative adjectives (e.g., &ldquo;stupid,&rdquo; &ldquo;incompetent&rdquo;) better than positive ones (e.g., &ldquo;happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;productive&rdquo;). The researcher could have participants study a single list that includes both kinds of words and then have them try to recall as many words as possible. The researcher could then count the number of each type of word that was recalled. There are many ways to determine the order in which the stimuli are presented, but one common way is to generate a different random order for each participant.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.8dwyhbaeqf2m"><span>Key Takeaways</span></h2><ul class="c8 lst-kix_h3i536doa43j-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Research settings in psychology and neuroscience fall into two categories: the field and the laboratory.

Experiments have two fundamental features. The first is that the researchers manipulate, or systematically vary, the level of the independent variable. The different levels of the independent variable are called conditions. For example, in </span><span class="c4">Darley and Latan&eacute;&rsquo;s bystander helping experiment (1968)</span><span class="c0">, the independent variable was the number of witnesses that participants believed to be present. The researchers manipulated this independent variable by telling participants that there were either 1, 2, or 5 other students involved in the discussion, creating three conditions. The second fundamental feature is that the researcher controls, or minimizes the variability in, variables other than the independent and dependent variables, called extraneous variables. Darley and Latan&eacute; tested all their participants in the same room and exposed them to the same emergency situation. They also randomly assigned their participants to conditions so that the three groups would be similar to each other to begin with. Notice that although the words manipulation and control have similar meanings in everyday language, researchers make a clear distinction between them. They manipulate the independent variable by systematically changing its levels and control other variables by holding them constant.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.4c7d2vuosvh"><span>8.1.1 Manipulating Experimental Variables</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">To manipulate an independent variable means to change its level systematically, and researchers working on humans and animals have two options to do this. In a </span><span class="c10 c4">between-subjects</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;design,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">different groups</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of participants are exposed to different levels of the manipulated variable. In a </span><span class="c10 c4">within-subjects design, </span><span class="c4">the same group </span><span class="c4">of participants is exposed to different levels at different times</span><span class="c10 c4">. </span><span class="c4">Between-subjects experiments have the advantage of being conceptually simpler and requiring less testing time per participant. They also avoid carryover effects without the need for counterbalancing. Within-subjects experiments have the advantage of controlling extraneous participant variables, which generally reduces noise in the data and makes it easier to detect a relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Using one type of design does not preclude using the other type in a different study. There is no reason that a researcher could not use both a between-subjects design and a within-subjects design to answer the same research question </span><span class="c4">(Stamp </span><span class="c3">et al.,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;2008)</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">An example of a simple between-subjects design is the study of the sexiness of the colour red, by offering women a choice of a coloured T-shirt to wear for an anticipated interaction with another person </span><span class="c4">(Elliot </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2013).</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The manipulated variable was the person these participants </span><span class="c3">thought</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;they would meet based upon a description: an attractive man, an unattractive man, or an average-looking woman. The researchers recruited only bisexual and heterosexual women, and they tailored their description to make the attractive man description most appealing. </span><span class="c0">The different levels of the independent variable are referred to as conditions, and researchers often give them short descriptive names to make it easy to talk about them, like attractive man, unattractive man, and average woman (Figure 8.1)</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c31 c30 c33"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 520.50px; height: 372.86px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 520.50px; height: 372.86px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Figure 8.1: Experimental design for a study looking at anticipated Interaction &amp; clothing colour choice in bisexual and heterosexual women.

Comparing groups of people who differ on a variable of interest </span><span class="c3">before</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the study begins is not the same as manipulating that variable. </span><span class="c4">For example, a researcher who compares the resting blood pressure of people who write daily in a journal with that of people who don&rsquo;t, has </span><span class="c3">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;manipulated anything, this variable is pre-existing. Although there are different groups, they were not randomly assigned so this isn&rsquo;t an experiment. </span><span class="c4">This is important because groups that already differ in one way at the beginning of a study are likely to differ in other ways too. People who choose to keep journals might have more time on their hands than people who do not. So, any observed difference between the two groups in terms of their blood pressure might have been caused by whether or not they keep a journal, </span><span class="c3">or</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;maybe daily journalers might have a more relaxed lifestyle that allows time for reflective activities.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Active manipulation of the independent variable is crucial for eliminating this third-variable problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There are many situations where the independent variable can&rsquo;t be manipulated for practical or ethical reasons, so an experiment is not possible. For example, whether or not people have a significant early life illness cannot be manipulated, making it impossible to do an experiment on the effect of early life illness on the development of autoimmune disorders. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t study the relationship between early illness experiences and autoimmune disorders, but it must be done using non-experimental approaches. </span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.a6zarntha93p"><span class="c42">8.1.2 </span><span class="c19">Controlling Extraneous Variables</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">An extraneous variable is anything that varies in the context of a study other than the independent and dependent variables. In an experiment on the effect of expressive writing on health, for example, extraneous variables would include individual differences such as writing ability, &nbsp;diet, and shoe size, these are called </span><span class="c10 c4">participant variables</span><span class="c0">. They would also include situational variables such as the time of day when participants write, whether they write by hand or a keyboard, and the weather. Extraneous variables pose a problem because many of them can affect the dependent variable. For example, participants&rsquo; health will be affected by many things other than whether or not they engage in expressive writing. This can make it difficult to separate the effect of the independent variable from the effects of the extraneous variables.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Situational variables</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are held constant by testing participants in the same location, giving them identical instructions, and treating them in the same way as much as possible. It can also mean holding participant variables constant by limiting participation to specific categories, in fact many psychology studies collect data from 18-25 year olds enrolled in undergraduate university courses. The obvious downside to this approach is that it lowers the external validity of the study, the extent to which the results can be generalized beyond the people actually studied. For example, it might be unclear whether results obtained with a sample of young university students would apply to retired plumbers. In many situations, the advantages of a diverse sample outweigh the reduction in noise achieved by a homogeneous one.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.s99qa7a6nufo"><span>8.2 Elements of Experiments</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The primary method to ensure that individual differences between participants are controlled is to use </span><span class="c10 c4">random assignment </span><span class="c4">to conditions. This is not the same thing as random sampling, which is a method for</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;selecting </span><span class="c0">a sample from a population. Random assignment is a method for assigning participants in a sample to the different conditions, and it is an important element of all experimental research..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In its strictest sense, random assignment should meet two criteria. One is that each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to each condition (e.g., a 50% chance of being assigned to each of two conditions). The second is that each participant is assigned to a condition independently of other participants. A simple coin toss can do this, if the coin lands heads, the participant is assigned to Condition A, and if it lands tails, they&rsquo;re assigned to Condition B. For three conditions, you could use an app to generate a random integer from 1 to 3 for each participant. If the integer is 1, the participant is assigned to Condition A; if it is 2, the participant is assigned to Condition B; and if it is 3, the participant is assigned to Condition C. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">One problem with coin flipping and other strict procedures for random assignment is that they can result in unequal sample sizes in the different conditions, which can be a problem for some types of statistical tests. So it&rsquo;s standard practice to use a kind of modified random assignment that keeps the number of participants in each group as similar as possible. In </span><span class="c10 c4">block randomization</span><span class="c4">, all the conditions occur once in the sequence before any of them is repeated. Then they all occur again before any of them is repeated again. Within each of these &ldquo;blocks,&rdquo; the conditions occur in a random order and each new participant is assigned to the next condition in the sequence. Random assignment is not </span><span class="c3">guaranteed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to control all extraneous variables across conditions. It is always possible that just by chance, the participants in one condition might turn out to be substantially older, less tired, more motivated, or less depressed on average than the participants in another condition. However, random assignment works better than one might expect, especially for large samples. Another is that the inferential statistics that researchers use to decide whether a difference between groups reflects a difference in the population takes the &ldquo;fallibility&rdquo; of random assignment into account. Yet another reason is that even if random assignment does result in a confounding variable and therefore produces misleading results, this is likely to be detected when the experiment is replicated. The upshot is that random assignment to condition, although not infallible in terms of controlling extraneous variables, is always considered a strength of a research design.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Between-subjects experiments are often used to determine whether an intervention works. To do this, participants are randomly assigned to either an </span><span class="c10 c4">experimental condition</span><span class="c4">, where they receive the treatment, or a </span><span class="c10 c4">control condition</span><span class="c0">, where they do not. If participants in the experimental condition produce different responses than the control condition, then the researcher can conclude that the treatment had an effect. In research on the effectiveness of medical treatments, this type of experiment is often called a randomized clinical trial.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/sTn4U1XnUA4&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586797137&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jN_Mj4qK9Na95-eOhTuuu">Elements of Experiments video</a></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.951zd4ry9l4w"><span class="c6">8.3 Complex Experiments</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Imagine that you made the effort to find a research topic, reviewed the research literature, formulated a question, designed an experiment, obtained REB approval, recruited participants, and manipulated an independent variable. It would seem almost wasteful to measure a single dependent variable. Even if you&rsquo;re primarily interested in the relationship between an independent variable and one primary dependent variable, there are usually several more questions that you can answer easily by including multiple dependent variables.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">When an experiment includes multiple dependent variables, there&rsquo;s a possibility of carryover effects so the order in which multiple dependent variables are measured becomes an issue. One approach is to measure them in the same order for all participants (Verdan </span><span class="c3">et al.,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;2012),, usually with the most important one first so that it cannot be affected by measuring the others. Another approach is to counterbalance, or systematically vary, the order in which the dependent variables are measured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Just as including multiple dependent variables in the same experiment allows one to answer more research questions, so too does including multiple independent variables. Including multiple independent variables also allows the researcher to answer questions about whether the effect of one independent variable depends on the level of another. This is referred to as an </span><span class="c10 c4">interaction</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;between the independent variables. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most common approach to including multiple independent variables in an experiment is the factorial design. In a factorial design, each level of one independent variable (or factor) is combined with each level of the others to produce all possible combinations. Each combination, then, becomes a condition in the experiment. Imagine an experiment on the effect of mobile phone use (yes vs. no) and time of day (day vs. night) on driving ability. Graphically, in a table, the columns would represent mobile phone use, and the rows represent time of day. The four cells of such a table represent the four possible combinations or conditions: using a mobile phone during the day, not using a mobile phone during the day, using a mobile phone at night, and not using a mobile phone at night. This particular design is a 2 &times; 2 (two-by-two) factorial design because it combines two variables, each of which has two levels. If one of the independent variables had a third level (e.g., using a handheld phone, using a hands-free phone, and not using a phone), then it would be a 3 &times; 2 factorial design, and there would be six distinct conditions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notice that the number of possible conditions is the product of the numbers of levels. A 2 &times; 2 factorial design has four conditions, a 3 &times; 2 factorial design has six conditions, a 4 &times; 5 factorial design would have 20 conditions, and so on. It&rsquo;s also possible to manipulate one independent variable between subjects and another within subjects. This is called a mixed factorial design. For example, a researcher might choose to treat mobile phone use as a within-subjects factor by testing the same participants both while using a phone and while not using a phone (while counterbalancing the order of these two conditions). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">In principle, factorial designs can include any number of independent variables with any number of levels. For example, an experiment could include the type of psychotherapy (cognitive vs. behavioral), the length of the psychotherapy (2 weeks vs. 2 months), </span><span class="c4">and delivery method (in person or online</span><span class="c0">. This would be a 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 factorial design with eight conditions. In practice, however, it is unusual to have more than three independent variables with more than two or three levels each because the number of conditions can become unmanageable. For example, adding a fourth independent variable with three levels (e.g., therapist experience: low vs. medium vs. high) to the current example would make it a 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 3 factorial design with 24 distinct conditions!</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.lcgi5tt4jvk6"><span>8.3.1 </span><span class="c31 c41">Manipulation Check</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">In many experiments, the independent variable is a construct that can only be manipulated indirectly. For example, a researcher might try to manipulate participants&rsquo; stress levels by telling them that they have 5 minutes to prepare a short speech to an audience of other participants. In such situations, researchers often include a </span><span class="c10 c4">manipulation check</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in their procedure. A manipulation check is a separate measure of the construct the researcher is trying to manipulate. Researchers trying to alter participants&rsquo; stress levels could give them a paper-and-pencil stress questionnaire or take their blood pressure to verify that their stress manipulation worked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Manipulation checks become especially important when the manipulation of the independent variable turns out to have no effect on the dependent variable. Imagine, for example, that you exposed participants to happy or sad music to put them in happy or sad moods but you found that this had no effect on the number of happy or sad memories they recalled. This could be because being in a happy or sad mood has no effect on memories for events. But it could also be that the music was ineffective at putting participants in happy or sad moods. A manipulation check, like a self-report of participants&rsquo; moods, would help resolve this uncertainty. If it showed that you had successfully manipulated mood with music, then it would suggest that there&rsquo;s no effect of mood on memory. But if it showed that you didn&rsquo;t successfully manipulate participants&rsquo; moods, then it would appear that you need a more effective manipulation to answer your research question.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/4pzyLkaJq9Y&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586805442&amp;usg=AOvVaw0xzNN2rJUDKtOjFS7fh2aM">Complex Experiments video</a></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.mn09iek0c1c"><span class="c6">Key Takeaways</span></h2><ul class="c8 lst-kix_j6lop2qotbrj-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span>An experiment is a type of empirical study that features the manipulation of an independent variable, the measurement of a dependent variable, and control of extraneous variables.</span></li></ul><ul class="c8 lst-kix_h3i536doa43j-0"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Experiments can be conducted using either between-subjects or within-subjects designs.

They&rsquo;re often difficult to detect and can have large effects on results. The only way to deal with them is to be on the lookout for them. </span><span class="c0">A confounding variable is an extraneous variable that differs on average across levels of the independent variable. For example, in a participant motivation can be an extraneous variable in experiments using human participants. If you asked participants to sign up for a study and you assigned the first half to your experimental group and the last half as your control. &nbsp;If your study was looking at the effect of caffeine on an attention task, it&rsquo;s possible your experimental group, who got caffeine, might do better than the caffeine-free control group because they&rsquo;re keener on participating in research. In this case motivation would be a confounding variable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">To confound means to confuse, and this is exactly what confounding variables do. Because they differ across conditions, just like the independent variable, they provide an alternative explanation for difference in the outcome. One way to avoid confounding variables is by holding extraneous variables constant. For example, you could prevent motivation from becoming a confounding variable by limiting participation only to those who completed a short survey first; this ensures you&rsquo;re getting a sample of participants who complete tasks. However, this approach is not always desirable because it could lead to an unrepresentative sample. </span><span class="c0">A more inclusive strategy is random assignment to conditions, this ensures that the groups are similar even if the individuals within them vary.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/0QPTce6aEnM&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586814067&amp;usg=AOvVaw03Z2le6nEyTQHXrLcxTCFS">Confounds video</a></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.v066y4fhdayx"><span class="c6">9.2 Expectancy Effects</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Psychology and Neuroscience research studies use living beings as subject matter, so experiments necessarily involve social interactions between researchers and participants. As far as we know, geochemists don&rsquo;t worry if the quartz in their rock sample knows it&rsquo;s being observed. Psychologists and Neuroscientists </span><span class="c3">do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;have to worry about this, since both human and non-human animals act very differently when they know they&rsquo;re being watched. Also, experimenters must be careful that their own biases don&rsquo;t alter behaviour of their participants. We&rsquo;ll consider two types of expectancy effects, participant and experimenter.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.1ulzav4foup8"><span class="c42">9.2.1 </span><span class="c19">Participant Expectancy</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Participant expectancy,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;also called subject expectancy, occurs when a research subject expects a given result and consciously or unconsciously affects the outcome. The best known example of this is the </span><span class="c4 c10">placebo effect</span><span class="c4">, which is a participant&rsquo;s reaction to a simulated treatment that lacks any active ingredient. </span><span class="c0">Placebo effects are interesting in their own right, but they also pose a serious problem for researchers who want to determine whether a treatment works. One solution is to include a placebo control condition, where participants receive a placebo that looks much like the treatment but lacks the active ingredient or element thought to be responsible for the treatment&rsquo;s effectiveness. When participants in a treatment condition take a pill, for example, then those in a placebo control condition would take an identical-looking pill that lacks the active ingredient in the treatment (sometimes called a sugar pill). If there&rsquo;s a change in the dependent variable similar to the experimental group, it&rsquo;s unlikely that the treatment is doing anything above and beyond the participants&rsquo; expectations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Of course, the principle of informed consent requires that participants be told that they&rsquo;ll be assigned to either a treatment or a placebo control condition, even though they can&rsquo;t know until the experiment ends. In medical studies, participants in the control condition are usually offered an opportunity to have the real treatment once their participation in the study ends. An alternative approach is to use a waitlist control condition, where participants are told that they will receive treatment but must wait until the participants in the treatment condition have already received it. This allows researchers to compare participants who have received the treatment with participants who are not currently receiving it but who still expect to improve (eventually). A final solution to the problem of placebo effects is to leave out the control condition completely and compare any new treatment with the best available alternative treatment. For example, a new treatment for simple phobia could be compared with standard exposure therapy. Because participants in both conditions receive a treatment, their expectations about improvement should be similar. This approach also makes sense because once there is an effective treatment, the interesting question about a new treatment is not simply &ldquo;Does it work?&rdquo; but &ldquo;Does it work better than what is already available?&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c1 c15" id="h.9nfn1gmeq88b"><span class="c42">9.2.2 </span><span class="c42">Experimenter Expectancy Effects</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c4">Experimenter expectancy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;refers to a situation where the researcher&rsquo;s expectations of the outcome of the study actually influences participants&rsquo; responses. This is also called the observer expectancy effect, or the Rosenthal effect after University of California at Irvine professor Robert Rosenthal who published several experiments demonstrating this &nbsp;</span><span class="c4">(Rosenthal, 1976)</span><span class="c0">. This is an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby an individual&rsquo;s expectations about an event changes their own and others&#39; behaviour in such a way to reinforce the initial prediction. If this happens to an experimenter in a research study it can weaken the internal validity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">For example, if an experimenter expects participants in a treatment group to perform better on a task than those in a control group, they might unintentionally give the treatment group participants clearer instructions or allow them more time to complete the task. In a striking example, Rosenthal and Fode had several undergraduate students in a laboratory course train rats to run through a maze. Although the rats were genetically similar, some students were told that they were working with &ldquo;maze-bright&rdquo; rats that had been bred to be good learners, and the others were told that they were working with &ldquo;maze-dull&rdquo; rats, bred to be poor learners. Sure enough, over five days of training, the &ldquo;maze-bright&rdquo; rats made more correct responses, made the correct response more quickly, and improved more steadily than the &ldquo;maze-dull&rdquo; rats </span><span class="c4">(Rosenthal &amp; Fode, 1963</span><span class="c0">). Clearly it had to have been the students&rsquo; expectations about how the rats would perform that made the difference. But how? Some clues come from data gathered at the end of the study, which showed that students who expected their rats to learn quickly felt more positively about their animals and reported behaving toward them in a more friendly manner, like handling them more.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/RDbWnA_nEPQ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586821924&amp;usg=AOvVaw35p1rsfxjdv8wOChqdk6Ms">Expectancy Effects video</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The way to minimize unintended variation in the procedure is to standardize it as much as possible so that it is carried out in the same way for all participants regardless of the condition they&rsquo;re in. Creating a written protocol for experimenters to follow with standard instructions that participants read themselves or that are read to them can reduce variation in procedures. Automating the rest of the procedure as much as possible by using software is also helpful. Another good practice is to arrange for the experimenters to be</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">blind</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">to the research question or to the condition that each participant is tested in, which minimizes experimenter expectancy effects by minimizing experimenters&rsquo; expectations. In a study where each participant receives a drug or a placebo, it&rsquo;s best if neither the participants nor the experimenter knows which condition they&rsquo;ve been assigned to. Because both the participants and the experimenters are blind to the condition, this is referred to as a</span><span class="c10 c4">&nbsp;double-blind study</span><span class="c4">. A </span><span class="c10 c4">single-blind study</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is one in which the participant, but not the experimenter, is blind to the condition. Sometimes blinding isn&rsquo;t possible, like in case studies with a single participant or when the experimenter must know the condition because they must carry out the procedure in a different way in the different conditions.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.iuere6bzrhmi"><span class="c6">Key Takeaways</span></h2><ul class="c8 lst-kix_qzdxv195ahl3-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Confounds are hidden variables that are intertwined with the independent variable, threatening the internal validity of an experiment</span></li><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Participant expectancy can influence results of studies in psychology and neuroscience.

This is done to determine if pre-existing participant variables, like age or gender, are differently affected by the manipulated variable. In Darley &amp; Latan&eacute;&rsquo;s famous bystander helping experiment </span><span class="c4">(1968)</span><span class="c4">, people were more likely to respond to an emergency if they thought they were the only witness; the larger the number of perceived bystanders the less likely participants were to help. This was a surprising finding, so they were also interested in whether certain traits influenced participants&rsquo; helping behaviour, in other words, were there any heroes in their sample? So they administered standardized questionnaires for authoritarianism, social responsibility, social desirability, and demographics and then categorized participants based on their scores. </span><span class="c3">None</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of these quasi-independent variables were associated with speed of helping, for instance women were just as likely to ignore an emergency as men when they thought there were other witnesses, suggesting that most people in &nbsp;a crowd will behave as unresponsive bystanders. By measuring these personality variables, they were able to support the hypothesis that the social situation was the main determinant of helping behaviour in this context.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">One study that found a significant association between an independent and quasi-independent variable looked at the effect of induced</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;disgust on moral judgement</span><span class="c4">s (</span><span class="c4">Schnall </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c4">2008). The researchers used imaginative methods to induce feelings of disgust, like exposing participants to novelty fart spray or having them do the study in a messy room. Feeling physically disgusted is an important part of natural escape and avoidance behaviours, so people who are more easily &ldquo;grossed out&rdquo; might be more sensitive to this. So in addition to their manipulated variable, the researchers also had participants complete a modified version of the 5-item survey on Private Body Consciousness</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;by Miller </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1981):</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On a scale from 1 (disagree strongly) to 6 (agree strongly), indicate your agreement with the following statements: </span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_4bqqssqhmo08-0 start"><li class="c21 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I am sensitive to internal bodily tensions</span></li><li class="c21 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I know immediately when my mouth or throat gets dry</span></li><li class="c16 c21 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I can often feel my heart beating</span></li><li class="c21 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">I am quick to sense the hunger contractions of my stomach</span></li><li class="c21 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">I am very aware of changes in my body temperature</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Participants read different moral scenarios ranging from falsifying information on a resume to people considering cannibalism after a plane crash. They then rated them on a 7-point scale with higher scores indicating harsher moral judgement, randomly assigned to do this in a gross messy room with dirty takeout containers or in a clean room as a control. Researchers split the participants into two groups, high and low, based upon their questionnaire scores and found that those with high body consciousness made harsher judgements when in the messy room compared to the clean room, there was little difference for participants who scored low on this trait (Schnall </span><span class="c3">et al.</span><span class="c4">, 2008)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/vyw2--MFI9A&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586831778&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HqV4HBbyX4A7eJ8nz-wII">Quasi-independent Designs video</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Such studies are extremely common, and there are several points worth making about them. First, quasi-independent variables are usually participant variables (like private body consciousness or age), and so by definition are between-subjects factors. For example, people are the age they are; they can&rsquo;t be tested in both young and old conditions at the same time. Second, such studies are generally considered to be experiments as long as at least </span><span class="c3">one</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;independent variable is manipulated, regardless of the number of non-manipulated independent variables included. Third, causal conclusions can only be drawn about the manipulated independent variable. For example, Schnall and her colleagues (2008) were justified in concluding that disgust affected the harshness of their participants&rsquo; moral judgments because they manipulated that variable and randomly assigned participants </span><span class="c4">to the clean or messy room.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;But they would not have been justified in concluding that participants&rsquo; private body consciousness affected the harshness of their participants&rsquo; moral judgments because they didn&rsquo;t manipulate that variable. It could be that having a strict moral code and a heightened awareness of one&rsquo;s body are both caused by some third variable </span><span class="c4">(e.g., neuroticism</span><span class="c0">) so it&rsquo;s important to be aware of which variables in a study are manipulated and which are not.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.neq92y1srbue"><span class="c6">10.2 Research Design in Neuroimaging</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Non-invasive imaging of brain structure and activity is one of the most important technological advances in neuroscience research. It has allowed us to ask questions about the living human brain that were not possible 50 years ago. But good data from neuroimaging depends upon solid research design, so we&rsquo;ll explore some issues that arise with this type of research</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are many techniques to assess brain structure but we&rsquo;ll focus on those that measure brain activity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is powerful because it gives detailed images of brain structure as well as measurement of oxygenated blood flow, taken as an indication of neuronal activity. Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) operates on a similar concept, except it detects blood flow by measuring how it responds to infrared light shone from the scalp. Positron emission tomography (PET) uses a radioactive tracer to measure metabolic or biochemical activity. If oxygen is radioactively tagged and injected it can also be used to track oxygenated blood flow in the brain, but it doesn&rsquo;t produce detailed structural images like fMRI. PET can also be done using radioactive glucose to assess neuronal energy use. Electroencephalogy (EEG) measures electrical activity directly from electrodes placed on the scalp so technically isn&rsquo;t a neuroimaging method because it doesn&rsquo;t produce pictures of the brain. However it&rsquo;s excellent for assessing changes on a fast time scale.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of neuroimaging is highlighted by a 2006 study that used fMRI to communicate with a woman who was in a coma for 5 months after a car accident. They asked her to imagine certain actions, such as playing tennis or walking around her home, and fMRI showed the same brain activation as controls without head injury (Figure 10.1). &nbsp;The fact that she could respond with her own brain activity in an intentional, purposeful way allowed her to communicate despite her inability to move. </span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 680.45px; height: 293.34px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 680.45px; height: 293.34px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Figure 10.1: Region-specific fMRI activation for tennis imagery (left) and spatial navigation (right) for a woman in a vegetative state (top) and an age-matched control (bottom). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In order to do these miracles with neuroimaging, there are some important research design considerations. One problem with neuroimaging research is the amount of noise in the data, the brain is always busy so the activity of interest is buried under all sorts of other thinking. To deal with this, researchers usually do a number of trials for the tasks participants are asked to do. That way if there&rsquo;s a consistent response across trials, it should show up every time within the noise. Another important component of imaging is subtracting the noisy thinking from the activity of interest, so results are almost always displayed as a comparison to an appropriate control condition. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This subtraction of baseline control activity usually requires within-subjects measurements, which is helpful because individual brains vary a lot, like the location and size of the bumps and grooves on the cortex. For between-subjects comparisons researchers often use similar participants who are &ldquo;matched&rdquo; on several key characteristics like age, gender, and handedness. </span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c4">One of the most important parts of any experiment is choosing appropriate controls, which can be tricky with neuroimaging research. In one study, researchers were interested in brain activity associated with the rewarding properties of music, so they recruited some musicians and scanned their brains while listening to music they loved, in fact they were asked to choose a piece of music that reliably sent chills up their spine (Blood &amp; Zatorre, 2001). So what can be used as a control condition? Silence? If there was a difference in brain activity, it would be difficult to determine whether any differences were due to just hearing music </span><span class="c3">or</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;specifically the music that moves you deeply.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">So the researchers did a clever thing to get a sensible comparison. For the control condition, each participant heard the chills-up-your-spine music from </span><span class="c3">another </span><span class="c0">participant which meant any differences in the dependent variable couldn&rsquo;t be due to just hearing music. To ensure that this control worked as intended, they measured heart rate, &nbsp;muscle tension, and breathing rate as markers of arousal and found these were higher for participants while listening to their own chills-up-your-spine music compared to somebody else&rsquo;s (Figure 10.2). Music-induced chills were associated with increased activation of areas of the brain involved in emotion and reward (Blood &amp; Zatorre, 2001).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 438.50px; height: 454.45px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 438.50px; height: 454.45px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c4">Figure 10.2: Left panels show average heart rate, muscle tension measured by electromyogram (EMG), and respiration rate (RESP) for music that sends chills compared to control music. Right panel shows these measures for an individual participant.</span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c4">In between-subjects designs, the uniqueness of individual brains can be a problem when making comparisons. Matching participants on known variables like age and handedness is commonly done in neuroimaging studies to try and minimize potential differences. There are reasons to be concerned about handedness in studies of lateralized cognitive tasks, like language and face processing; ambidextrous and left handed participants are slightly more likely to have reversed lateralization. One unintended consequence of this practice is a persistent participant sampling bias in this field. </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">A systematic review of over 1000 articles published in 2017 in three high profile journals, </span><span class="c3">NeuroImage</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c3">Cerebral Cortex</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">Human Brain Mapping, </span><span class="c4">revealed that 80% of studies used </span><span class="c3">only </span><span class="c4">right-handers. This excludes approximately 10% of the population who are left-handed or ambidextrous, also called adextral (meaning non-right). When organized articles by topic, clinical studies were more likely to include </span><span class="c4">adextrals, </span><span class="c4">however this was still only about a third.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Adrextral </span><span class="c4">participants were more likely to be included in studies on children compared to adults (Bailey </span><span class="c3">et al.,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;2019). Almost half of the articles failed to report handedness at all. B</span><span class="c4">y excluding </span><span class="c4">adextrals</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from neuroimaging research it&rsquo;s not possible to check if their handedness makes their brains respond differently.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/dIKtha0nFLQ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586843383&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qm8MCBAYQPeVySu0W01EM">Research in Neuroimaging video</a></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.27mcvcldc5dh"><span class="c6">10.3 Clinical Trials</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clinical trials are the last step in medical research, they determine whether new treatments make it from bench to bedside. Because they put humans at potential risk, they&rsquo;re heavily monitored and regulated, so there are some special design issues with this type of research study.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Clinical research can be broadly categorized by the timing of data collection and the participants&rsquo; comparison conditions. </span><span class="c10 c4">Prospective studies</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;collect new data whereas </span><span class="c10 c4">retrospective studies</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;use data from the past, either through previous medical records or self-report. </span><span class="c10 c4">Cohort studies</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are within-subjects designs that look at some future outcome compared to baseline conditions. In a</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;prospective cohort</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;study, one group is exposed to something in the past or not, and future outcome measures are compared. In a </span><span class="c3">retrospective cohort</span><span class="c4">, researchers compare two groups that differ on a particular attribute and look</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for subsequent incidences</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of disease. </span><span class="c10 c4">Case-control studies</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are between-subjects and compare individuals of clinical interest with controls on some measure, usually by looking at the history of individuals with a particular disorder compared to those without.

Because their main goal is to make new effective treatments available to as many people as possible, they&rsquo;re subject to strict regulations to prevent harm to those who volunteer as human guinea pigs. In fact, RCTs for new drugs can&rsquo;t even start until they&rsquo;ve been tested on actual guinea pigs (or rats or mice) first.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s consider an RCT which compared two different antidepressant drugs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline and citalopram, against placebo in people with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Stahl, 2000). They took several self-report measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and drug tolerability as well as general health measures like blood pressure and body weight. The SSRIs produced the best symptom improvement, with citalopram having the quickest and largest effect. So who was in this study?

However, this necessarily comes at the cost of external validity. If a treatment only works in a specific group of people who never miss a pill, it might not generalize to regular people&rsquo;s everyday lives.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c27 c4 c31"></span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c0">The Covid pandemic fueled an explosion of RCTs with the race to create and improve vaccines, so in April of 2021 I (Jen Stamp) enrolled in an RCT for a new Covid vaccine, VBI-2902a. I was randomly assigned to the experimental group and received two active vaccine shots before I was told which treatment I received in November, when the study conditions were unblinded.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">This RCT was a double-blinded placebo-controlled - the person who popped in to give me the shots was not the same person who collected my data. This was done in case I improved because I </span><span class="c3">thought </span><span class="c0">I was getting an actual vaccine. A typical visit involved a Covid test, a pregnancy test, and a lot of blood collection. I also filled out a daily diary about pain and possible symptoms after each experimental injection. The care and rigor used in designing this randomized clinical trial is clear from the amount of work involved. However, like Stahl (2000), this study excluded biologically fertile women who were not taking pre-approved contraception. For me, each visit involved an unnecessary pregnancy test (we were in lockdown, I was single, perimenopausal, and lived alone) and an intimate conversation about my sex life with a stranger. This was an minor inconvenience and would not change my decision to participate, but 0% of the biologically fertile men of this protection of my potential unborn child </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c31 c38 c4"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c4">Selection bias is one of the biggest methodological challenges associated with clinical research. &nbsp;As with any study using living participants there is a risk of using a biased sample, but people with high socio-economic backgrounds might be more likely to enroll in RCTs because they have the means and time to commit to research participation. My involvement in the Covid vaccine RCT involved NINE, 1 hour visits and two phone calls. The SSRI clinical trial by Stahl (2000) required multiple measures over 24 weeks. RCTs looking at testing treatments like this usually require continued participation so those that don&rsquo;t adhere to the treatment regimen might differ in many ways from those who do. Therefore loss through attrition can lead to selection bias even with a good original sample.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c31 c38 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17 c25"><a class="c23" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/KwR0o6DOrxc&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750819586852971&amp;usg=AOvVaw2i0hLS-NeC-qtq2n0NVWAR">Clinical Trials video</a></span></p><h2 class="c1 c15" id="h.9s9kbm48wru6"><span class="c6">Key Takeaways</span></h2><ul class="c8 lst-kix_qzdxv195ahl3-0"><li class="c1 c16 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">Quasi-independent variables are pre-existing participant variables that are included as a grouping variable in experimental designs.
